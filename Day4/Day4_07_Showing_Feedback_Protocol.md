# Day 4 - Topic 07: Showing Feedback Protocol

## Overview

Showing feedback is a critical professional courtesy that helps both listing agents and sellers understand market perception of their property. However, it's also a common source of stress when not managed properly. Establishing clear feedback protocols protects your time, maintains professional relationships, and provides valuable information to all parties.

**Core Principle:** Set feedback expectations upfront, give honest buyer feedback promptly, and never engage in arguments with other agents.

## The Annoying Seller Problem

### What Happens Too Often

**Typical Scenario:**
1. Your listing gets shown at 2:00 PM
2. At 2:15 PM, seller calls: "What did they say?"
3. You respond: "They haven't even gotten home yet. They haven't even gotten out the door."
4. Seller calls again at 3:00 PM
5. And again at 5:00 PM
6. And the next day...

**Why Sellers Do This:**
- Excited and anxious about their home being shown
- Want information immediately
- Don't understand the feedback process
- Think you have instant information
- Emotionally invested in the outcome

**The Problem:**
- Constant interruptions disrupt your day
- You don't have information yet
- Creates stress for you and seller
- Wastes time on repeated conversations
- Makes you appear unprofessional if you have nothing to report

## The Professional Solution: Weekly Feedback Calls

### Setting Expectations Up Front

**When You Take the Listing:**

> "I will give you feedback on all of the showings once I get it, and I'll call you every Thursday."

### Why This System Works

**Benefits for the Agent:**
1. **Organized schedule:** One predictable call per week
2. **Time to gather information:** Agents have time to provide actual feedback
3. **Reduced interruptions:** No constant calls during the week
4. **Professional image:** Systematic and organized approach

**Benefits for the Seller:**
1. **Reduces anxiety:** Knows when to expect information
2. **Comprehensive updates:** Gets all feedback at once, can see patterns
3. **Better perspective:** Week's worth of showings provides real data
4. **Clear communication:** Scheduled call is thorough, not rushed

**Benefits for the Relationship:**
- Sets professional boundaries
- Creates trust through consistency
- Reduces emotional reactivity
- Allows for strategic conversations

### How to Handle the Impatient Seller

**If seller calls before Thursday:**

> "I know you're eager to hear feedback. I'm still gathering information from the showing agents. I'll have everything organized for our Thursday call. If anything urgent comes up, I'll call you immediately."

**This response:**
- Acknowledges their concern
- Reiterates the system
- Provides reassurance
- Sets exception for urgent matters

## Your Responsibility: GIVE Feedback

### The Feedback Request You'll Get

**After Every Showing:**

You will receive:
- Call from listing agent
- Text from listing agent
- Automated message from Showing Time
- Follow-up email

**The Request:**
> "Can you give me some feedback?"

### What They Really Want

**Critical Understanding:**
> "They don't want YOUR feedback - they want your CUSTOMER'S feedback."

**What listing agent wants to know:**
- What did the buyers think?
- What did they like?
- What were their concerns?
- Why didn't they make an offer (if applicable)?

**NOT asking for:**
- Your personal opinion
- Your market analysis
- Your criticism of their listing strategy
- Your thoughts on the seller

## How to Give Quality Feedback

### Ask Your Buyers Immediately After Showing

**In the car after showing:**

**Question 1:**
> "What did you think of that property?"

**Question 2:**
> "What did you like about it?"

**Question 3:**
> "What were your concerns?"

**Question 4:**
> "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate it compared to others we've seen?"

### Types of Honest, Constructive Feedback

**Good feedback examples:**

**Price-Related:**
- "Too much money for the square footage"
- "Priced above comparable sales in the area"
- "Not enough value for the price point"

**Condition-Related:**

- "Bathrooms need updating"
- "Roof appears to need replacement soon"
- "Carpet throughout needs replacing"

**Layout/Design:**

- "Further from town than they wanted"

**Positive Feedback (Important Too!):**

- "Their favorite so far, wants to see it again"

### What Good Feedback Accomplishes

**For the listing agent:**

- Provides market reality check

**For future buyers:**

## Feedback Scenarios and How to Handle Them

### Scenario 1: Buyer Hates the Property

**What your buyer says:**
> "That was terrible. Waste of time."

**Feedback to give:**
> "Property didn't meet buyer's needs. Looking for something more updated in similar price range."

**DON'T say:**
- "Property was awful"
- "Overpriced garbage"
- "Seller is delusional"

### Scenario 2: Buyer Loves It But Has Concerns

**What your buyer says:**
> "We love the house, but the kitchen is really outdated and we'd need to replace it immediately."

**Feedback to give:**
> "Buyers loved the layout and location. Main concern is outdated kitchen - they'd need to budget for immediate kitchen renovation. Still considering it but factoring in renovation costs."

**This feedback:**
- Honest about the issue
- Explains buyer's thought process
- Leaves door open for potential offer
- Gives seller useful information

### Scenario 3: Buyer Might Make an Offer

**What your buyer says:**
> "This is our favorite. I want to think about it tonight and talk about our offer strategy."

**Feedback to give:**
> "Buyers were very impressed. This is their favorite property so far. They're discussing financing and will be in touch within 24 hours if they'd like to make an offer."

**Why this feedback matters:**
- Listing agent can tell seller to hold off accepting other offers
- Creates urgency without commitment
- Professional courtesy
- Sets expectations

### Scenario 4: Wrong Property for Buyer

**What your buyer says:**
> "Nice house, but we need 4 bedrooms and this only has 3."

**Feedback to give:**

**This feedback:**
- Not about the property quality
- Explains the mismatch
- Quick and clear
- No hurt feelings

## Timing of Feedback

### When to Provide Feedback

**Best practice timeline:**

**Immediately after showing:**
- Ask your buyers for their thoughts
- Make mental notes or write them down

**Within 2-4 hours:**
- Respond to listing agent's request
- Even brief feedback is helpful

**Same day:**
- Ideal window for feedback
- Information is fresh
- Shows professionalism

**Within 24 hours:**
- Acceptable but less ideal
- Better than nothing
- Shows you didn't forget

### What If You Forget or Miss the Request?

**Recovery approach:**

> "Apologies for the delay. My buyers felt [feedback]. Thanks for the showing."

**Don't:**
- Make excuses
- Ignore the request
- Wait so long it doesn't matter

---

## Special Feedback Situations

### When Your Buyer Makes an Offer

**Immediate communication:**

Call the listing agent immediately (before submitting offer, if possible):
> "Just wanted to give you a heads up - my buyers loved the property and we're preparing an offer. You should have it within the hour."

**Why this professional courtesy matters:**
- Gives listing agent time to notify seller
- May prevent seller from accepting another offer
- Shows respect and professionalism
- Builds goodwill for negotiation

### When Buyer Wants Second Showing

**Feedback after first showing:**
> "Buyers are very interested. They'd like to schedule a second showing to bring [family member/contractor/inspector] to look at [specific concern]. Can we set that up for [proposed time]?"

**This tells listing agent:**
- Serious buyer
- Active interest
- Specific concern to address
- Moving forward

### When You Can't Reach Your Buyer for Feedback

**Temporary response:**
> "I haven't been able to connect with my buyers yet for their thoughts. I'll reach out as soon as I do."

**Follow up when you have information:**
> "Thanks for your patience. My buyers felt [feedback]."

## Feedback System for Your Own Listings

### How to Organize Feedback for Thursday Calls

**Create a feedback tracking system:**

**Spreadsheet or CRM tracking:**
- Date of showing
- Buyer agent name
- Feedback received
- Buyer interest level
- Follow-up needed

**Weekly summary for seller:**
- Number of showings
- Summary of feedback themes
- Pricing feedback
- Condition feedback
- Positive comments
- Action items (if any)

### Presenting Feedback to Sellers

**Structure of Thursday call:**

**Opening:**
> "We had [X] showings this week. Here's the feedback I gathered."

**Organize by themes:**
1. **Pricing feedback:** "3 agents mentioned price concerns"
2. **Condition feedback:** "2 buyers loved it but mentioned the kitchen"
3. **Positive feedback:** "All buyers commented on the beautiful backyard"

**Strategic discussion:**
> "Based on this week's feedback, here's what I'm thinking..."

**Action items:**
> "For next week, I recommend we..."

### When Feedback Suggests Price Adjustment

**How to present to seller:**

> "After 3 weeks and 12 showings, we're hearing consistent feedback that buyers love the home but feel it's priced $20K-$30K above comparable sales. Let's look at the numbers together and discuss whether a strategic price adjustment might generate offers."

**This approach:**
- Based on data (number of showings, consistent feedback)
- Not your opinion - it's market feedback
- Collaborative discussion, not demand
- Solution-oriented

## Professional Boundaries

### What You Don't Owe Other Agents

**You are NOT required to:**
- Provide your buyer's financial details
- Explain your buyer's entire decision-making process
- Justify why your buyer didn't like the property
- Spend 30 minutes on a feedback call

**Brief, honest feedback is sufficient:**
- 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Key points only
- Respectful and professional

### What You Shouldn't Share

**Confidential information:**
- Your buyer's maximum budget
- Their motivation timeline
- Their other properties under consideration
- Family situations or personal details

**Feedback should focus on the property, not buyer's private information.**

> "They don't want YOUR feedback - they want your CUSTOMER'S feedback."

> "Never have an argument with another agent. No matter how rude [they are]."

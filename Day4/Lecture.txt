Where'd that go I it was so great to meet you today

Right and always make that appointment And always I would say like I wouldn't be able to go to see a house without my wife so would you want to I like your wife Like I don't I just go and say OK sure or no OK you don't let me no problem let's go to the next one I don't make the decision So how do you get them you know some guys are like yeah no no I'm the one that but then they got to go back home and report so how do you get them together you you know what normally happens is the wife does want to go yeah so so it's usually the wife that picks the house And so I mean there have been occasion where I have the husband spit that house and the wife is fine with that you know but it it'll be rare that they don't both come you know and you can ask to say well you know is there anybody else going to be making this decision you know will they become you know the other more complicated situation that happens is this young couples who say Oh my parents are lending us the money and they want to come see the house Yeah and they always think the house is overpriced and it's not worth it and blah blah blah so what I do with that is I say OK if your parents are involved in the purchase you know let's have them come with us you know because otherwise you're showing them houses and they may make a decision that they want this house then the parent comes and they talk them out of it you know it's it's pretty pretty consistently does work that way but if you get to when you meet the parents don't treat them as an adversary You say 0 it's just really great that you're helping your kids buy a home you know and this market it's really hard to find a home so I would you know encourage you to help us as much as you can and you you encourage them get get involved with them Most people will treat them like their adversaries and that doesn't work now how do you get a client not to for example for me I think that my car dealership I'll have the decision maker the guy that picked it the husband and then a couple of friends I called on the lawyers so I usually just kick him out the the lowers like I don't know you're the one by you're the one making the decision you're you get out of here I don't I don't need you yeah and II try to separate them I mean you don't really say that right sometimes Sometimes yeah that wouldn't work here no no so how do you nicely remove them or you know talk your client into this is your decision you and your husband Why is this guy you won't find that I won't find that many people coming you might find I did I have found like let's say unquestion number are you familiar with the area yeah my friends just bought a house down the street you know and they go to the house and friends come



See I this woman answers the phone and I you know said you know I'm looking I was looking for a listing and I was calling to see if anybody knew of anybody in the neighborhood who might be thinking of selling and she said I can't believe this my husband and I are sitting here having our breakfast coffee we are so sick of this weather It wasn't exactly what she said she said we're so sick of this white **** We want to get out of here and where you going florida OK I have a friend in Florida let me have her send you some listings and I listed her house and got a referral fee yeah she was a character a very funny lady I love them they were they weather

make calls in bad weather, ppl stays home. 


Wanted to go somewhere warm make those calls I think I would go as far as identifying like the communities I want to work in and identifying those houses that have that You know that little old lady that's by herself husband pass and go help her with with the snow good idea that's great you know she's going to Remember Me forever and she's ready she's always had this is being creative that's why you're good that's why you own your own business because you're creative and you think out of the box it's this is all about thinking out of the box you know so that would be great but the calls are still more important you know and how are you going to find that little old lady we're going to know how to do it tomorrow We're going to you don't even have to walk around we're going to know how to do it tomorrow because by going into Remind you can you can filter anybody that's been in their home for 20 five years 30 years 1015 years anybody whose mortgage is paid off you can go to sell score to see anybody they know by the analytics whether a person is ready to sell you know they might be doing something on the computer like looking in Florida or looking for homes in retirement communities they have all of that information and you can find it very very easily how much that costs the company pays for it They pay for it through the MLS but the company pays through it through the MLSS not all MLSS have it new Jersey has it Garden State has it I don't think Hudson County has it vermont pretty sure it doesn't but you can you can find it it's fabulous if for some reason you're in a multiple that it doesn't have it your manager belongs to all the multiples so they should they're supposed to so just use theirs so you said before when you're showing someone a house and you ask them if they have a home on the market now or if they're selling or if they have to sell their other home you said you could refer it to an Asian in their area but couldn't you just list their other house also Oh yeah I'm just thinking if they're going to Florida oh if it's like far OK yeah if it's far away so so if they if it's like they're they live in Hoboken and they want to move to Fairlawn could you list a house in Hoboken absolutely I did yeah II was working out of Richwood most of the time so of course I could so yeah but it might be you might feel that you're not totally knowledgeable about it or you're not comfortable with it partner with somebody you know partner with another agent by the way it is going to be for your survival and I mean for your survival make sure you make friends in your office and have a partner of some kind whether it's somebody you pay or somebody you share with or or somebody that you say look if I'm sick could you cover for me if you're sick I'll cover for you winter's coming we all get colds or if I'm going on vacation I'll cover your customers if you're going on vacation you could you could do it that way works out a little bit better you know most of the time umm you know some kind of a cooperative thing I went when I was young and had young babies in our town we had a babysitting Co-op and and it was really cool because you knew these mothers you knew who they were and so they would babysit for you while you ran to the grocery store for two hours you might drop your kids at their house right I'd have their kids and we kept track of the hours and there was never about nothing wrong everything went well and you could pick what moms you wanted so you can pick what women or men you want to share with or work with and create a Co op all right so I gave you three hours with your customer you owe me three hours you know it doesn't even have to be that you know that specific but it is really really important you know the other thing you can do is you can work as a team You know you can create your own little partner more like a partnership than a team you can create that another thing you can do for instance gotta never had a team What she did was because she was just going after listings she would give the buyers out to agents for a referral fee So let's say she had it wasn't unusual for her to have at least 30 listings at any given time and now that she doesn't have as many because there's not that many listings out there but so and she got buyers inquiring about all of them sometimes she would take them most of the time she would give them to other agents in the office and they would get when they sold them they would pay her 25% so that's another way of working but and with that you don't have all the obligations of being a team leader you know making sure you bring in the buyers and all that good stuff when you send out a referral you need to sign like a contract Oh yeah absolutely it's in your zip forms there is a referral agreement yeah and make sure you your manager sees it and signs it too cool is there a set percentage percentage or is all negotiation yeah you know it depends on where you're sending it if if it's a very low price area you know at one point in certain sections of Florida could buy a home for maybe you still can I don't know 250,000 you're not going to charge a 40% referral fee for that you know but you might so you might charge 25% pretty much 25% is your lowest All of your UP City and Zillow referrals are close to 40% now so I we just look at that as something you just never would have had unless it was for them so that's extra Ilya's goal with his company was that between Solo Obsidian other lead generating systems he has that he wants to be able to provide agents with at least seven transactions that they would not have had during you know under their normal prospecting which would be you know cold call circle marketing farming and sphere of influence so he wanted to add seven more transactions to their life you know I keep hearing farming what is that OK so there is sometimes your circle marketing can turn into your farm or sometimes OK so God is a typical example of a form she had a huge form she sent out letters to all of Westwood Hillsdale Woodcliff Lake she started in Ridgewood but then stopped II think there were like seven towns that's why her you know but she did it every month You know if you want to if you have a lot of money you could become a success story right away by doing that every month constant mail outs constant mail outs constant mail outs for listings so a farm usually I recommend at least 250 people in a territory I recommend usually right around where you live because people know you and and what you do is you just decide what homes now with the with the wonders of ramine it used to be that every single home in this square you would send out to every month and some of it was a waste right because those people had just moved in or whatever with Remind now you can refine that that number to people who have a high cell score or who have lived in the house for more than 25 years they're about mortgages almost paid off or paid off and they're ready to size down or leave and you can just focus on those people every month right it has to be every month if you do it once and you don't do it again waste of money might as well have thrown the money away or give it as a donation somewhere but it must be every single month a farm takes anywhere from six months to a year to reap it's like a farm you put the seeds in you keep watering it and watering it and nourishing it until eventually it pays off so that's the farm so you you can do it to everybody in that group because you might just miss one that moved in a year ago and got divorced and their house is ready to sell so you might miss somebody but with remind you can kind of filter out the people that might not be ready to sell So how does that remind you generate like a list of addresses where you wanna yeah yeah and you can use you can use email for it because it'll give you their telephone numbers their email And So what you can do is you send out a card one month you might send out a letter with the stats for the town next month the next month if it's a holiday you might send I don't recommend sending out religious holiday cards OK but it would send out New Year's cards Everybody it's a New Year's for everybody right valentine cards Halloween is always a good one to send out and what you can do is you can look up their homes on the tax search in the MLS or on realist see when they bought it what day they closed on it and send them out a happy anniversary on the purchase of your home the date you bought the home You could do that by email or you could do that by text people get a lot of emails now so all this email marketing I mean I spent an hour last night cleaning up just the last two weeks Yeah so so the email situation so texting I think is a little better although they're getting a lot of commercial texting too now the best thing again is going back to those cards you can hand write a card and send it out you can order them on platform you know we were talking about rent versus buy the other day I was talking to Matt with that yesterday because he's working on a big on building where he lives that's all rental and so he's doing a rent versus 5 statistics on rent versus 5 and that's something another way you could do that could be a form now the form doesn't have to be only in one location right so let's say you have a farm you you you do a map on on Vermont and you pick out a an area right around your house and you do that but when you filter it you only come up with instead of 250 you come up with 25 right so you might want to go over here and try another neighborhood right and do the filter on that you got another 50 maybe until you so your form could be all over the place the one thing I do recommend on your farm is to always have a Main St Why do you think I want a Main Street Incorporate a main street in your farm why OK you live in Fairland Cresco I'm sorry where did I get Fairlawn from so let's say here's your farm around your neighborhood what's the main street is that Knickerbocker OK so yeah either Knickerbocker or Paramount that whole street I would do a mail out to every month because if you get a listing there your sign is there and everybody that comes in and out and up and down and all around seizure son By the way did you all get your your name things that go on the sign it it's the you're entitled to it Yeah you're supposed to get it automatically I think I didn't get it so when you get that thing from where does it come from I think comes from Sammy He comes from Sammy when you first join all the things you're entitled to could you open give me.



That are non owner occupied then those would be tenants right and you might just do it maybe you can do send them a rent versus by analysis yeah that would that would be totally but you know tomorrow Sammy will but I want you to go into the MLS and they have a they actually they have it on platform to remind seminar on on the academy you know to that tonight do that so because when Sammy goes through it he goes through it fast But he will be able to answer all of your questions probably better than I can R E M I N E it's like mining like yeah yeah so whoever made up all this.


Docuvera Online 

Or eighteen or twenty one every adult losing the house has to be on the lease by the way and has to have has to be qualified you know you have to have all that information.

credit check 


Do the credit you present it to the landlord he can do a conditional acceptance based on the credit if he insists on doing a criminal history go back to Dr Varus and they do the criminal history Two things that you must let your landlord know aside from the fact that they obviously you know have to abide by the Attorney General's memorandum and they can't be prejudice but one of the things they have to understand is that if they don't do the criminal history and this person happens to injure somebody you know I I'm thinking they should do a mental health history too but but they don't so if this person happens to hurt somebody they could be liable Or if they start making drugs in the house they could be liable you know who are they that Ocuvera or the agent Lieutenant Ohk OK yeah Dr Barris is just a it's it's just a credit reporting system yeah And and sometimes you'll see there's another one I forgot that combined there's just the one now so they're combined what was the other one. 



OK here here's another question

if you older business just simply say....at you're taking the listing you just If you older business just simply say well you know might be a good idea for me to establish help you establish what the value of your home is before we move forward not even that you're taking the listing you just establishing the value of their home right OK number 7 the home you called on is listed in you know in the nine hundreds is that the price range you're interested in And they may say well you know maybe that's a little high for us they may say well no we can you know really go a little higher Interesting way of not asking that question but getting the same answer is prospecting in your MLS you put that client into into the MLS as your client and and fill out what they need you know they want 3 bedrooms they want this very broad and put them into prospecting you te....ime when I get it is that OK with you


But guess what else they'll be able to do they'll be able to search so let's say they told you they only want to spend 700 and then you go in and you can see what they're searching for and if they're searching for 900 you kind of know hey they are looking for more like a $900,000 home right they don't know you can see it you know so I would tell them say you know I would tell them oh by the way II saw your search be honest with them I saw your search is is it really that is there anything in that price range you would like to see Are you talking about one home or what what software is that you can see what client was looking for in New Jersey MLS the safe search or when you do in when you put them in prospecting


In a different market you might have to change your strategy but in this market they want to know everything real time I gave you that I think I gave this example it was actually Rafael Moto brand new agent had a customer who was referred to her by her husband and they were desperate to buy a house She put them on prospecting but she thought oh I don't want to disturb them they both work very hard I'll only send it at 6:00 at night after they get home from work You know what the customer did the wife called her up and said you know I don't understand this how come I can see it on Zillow before you send it to me she wanted it real time she never asked her so they they adjusted that so you asked them do you want it real time do you want to see the listings as soon as they come up on the market and they say yes or they say no Do you want me to send it to you every day or would you like me to send it to you only once a week How would you like it and then if there's anything you like or that you you know you you they can write notes on it by the way you can write a note look I'd like to see this whatever but if there's anything you like give me a call and I'll be happy to make an appointment for you Right he must have been sitting behind his computer all day you know so III appreciate II you know compared to all the other agents I had you know like I almost bought a hospital I got an accepted offer but then I just don't want to move so far away he he was he was on the ball he was you know he he was too aggressive like I was afraid of if I hit this he's gonna call me in 5 minutes I would even open I would even see the listings I know I was gonna get a call like three calls right back yeah but you should have told him look do me a favor only could you only call me you know on Fridays you know yeah just call me only on Fridays or something like that I mean there's two ways but on the other hand his aggressiveness is what most people wanted during this market they they wanted to know immediately and so that's what he he got in step with that maybe and you need to say look I'm I'm not that much of a hurry you know i'm not i'm not that aggressive yeah I need it but he should have asked you how would you like me to work with you Right and that's always the you're giving yourself permission to work with them a certain way you know permission for them to call you permission for you to show the house permission permission permission once you get that you're fine and people understand I would always tell my customers because they would call me every time we had a showing it was annoying talk about annoying so I have a customer I have three listings I have 4 listings the house gets shown by another broker they would call me immediately what do they say I said they haven't even gotten home yet They haven't even gotten out the door you know So what I did was I said look you know I will give you feedback on all of the showings once I get it and I'll call you every Thursday You had to do that But people get so excited about their home being shown that they want information before literally the realtor leaves the door you know and you can't you can't do it and you II explained that to him I said you know sometimes the agent doesn't get feedback right away you know so you as Realtors by the way every time you show a house you will get a call or a text from either showing time or directly from the other realtor saying can you give me some feedback You don't get him so much now because houses are selling right away but if the house has been on the market you know the feedback and they don't want your feedback they want your customers feedback the customer said the you know the the kitchen was outdated or this or that whatever you know it was too much money it was whatever for the for the square footage so that that's what you will get and I advise you to be nice and answer it because you're helping them and someday you may need their help you know always never have an argument with another agent as as rude as they can be Somebody's really rude to you yelling and screaming I just say Gee I'm very sorry you feel that way Yeah that's it.


She was new and she got a call for a house that was like I don't know I'm guessing the price it was way back when let's say it was 400 and she went out and saw every $400,000 home so she knew what she was doing and was well prepared to show them the customer comes in and I knew we were in trouble because the wife had this gorgeous meat coat on and they were driving a Mercedes and she he had a newspaper in the sand that's how long it goes and he had circles around properties and he said I was wondering could we as long as we're here could we see these properties they were all in the nine hundreds she almost she almost collapsed you know she was not prepared for that and so she did take him out she did show him and and we recovered but if she had asked that question and I was there so I said you know just out of curiosity why did you call on a 400 when you can spend this and he goes well I just wondering what you got for 400 what could you get just out of curiosity so OK and if you don't do these things you're gonna look like you're not prepared you're gonna look them you know so it'll show on your face Now this number 8 is very very very important Were there any other homes or ads that interested you and why are we asking that Do you think everybody knows that you can show every home in New Jersey And why don't they know that'cause we don't tell him yeah and because where they came from might have been New York where they don't have a centralized MLS well they have one it just doesn't work So if you're looking in Hell's Kitchen or you're looking on the Upper East Side you're going to find Realtors that have listings that they don't share right booking in the village it was looking in Soho Noho wherever you're looking they don't share So they have to go to this one to this one to this one to get what they want right so but we don't we have what do we have what's up what kind of multiple do we have what is it What do you call it It's a forced multiple by that every single listing we have whether it's an office exclusive sharing or non sharing cooperating not cooperating general you know launched listing must be in the in MLS now all of our MLS I don't care if it's Garden State New Jersey Bergen Hudson County all must be in within 24 hours or you get a huge gun This is a you know a a situation where the guidelines the ethics are we are to share everything must be in the MLS within 24 hours what's your dates and when you sign things it has to be in in 24 hours If you have a listing and it goes under contract it's an attorney review You must report it immediately You'll find in some brokerages they don't record attorney review in progress because they want to keep list of people coming in you know if you find that out that's that's not fair and equitable in other words you're trying to show it to a customer and there's that you call them and they say what can't be shown and why can't it be shown because it's an attorney review and they don't want to show it anymore And that makes you look foolish because this buyer is saying how come you didn't know that you know so it has to be reported immediately under contract must be reported immediately when it sells its closing date must be reported immediately if perchance the closing is delayed and it's delayed beyond a couple of days you must then update the closing date on the MLS has to be done OK now here's another question number 9 what are the most important features you're looking for This could be very specific you know....r football or baseball or what I need
 This could be very specific you know this can be really really specific and because you know sometimes people give you their dream their dream home all the things they want but not all of them no house is going to have them all you know I need a huge backyard because my kids like to play soccer or outside or football or baseball or what I need This could be very specific you know this can be really really specific and because you know sometimes people give you their dream their dream home all the things they want but not all of them no house is going to have them all you know I need a huge backyard because my kids like to play soccer or outside or football or baseball or what I need

I think it might be this Thursday hold on Alexander said I believe is this Wednesday or Thursday of next week this week No Wednesday tomorrow is Sammy OK i'm a second because I told her to put on my calendar because I'm getting I don't remember anything anymore i'm getting too old I don't know where my phone is but she texted me the day oh let me see that you were coming November 11th no no no it's not November 11th November 13th that's right the 13th the 13th which is next week next week's the 13th right yes and here's the only reason why we're not doing it Thursday because I have three boys my oldest is in high school and they have a state playoff game soccer at 2:00 on Thursday christian Brothers Academy down in Lynn Crawl we're going to get our **** kicked but anyway we have a game so this week's soccer will be over for me which is terrible to say but I'm kind of this is really weird I have you down for the 6th we were going to do the 6th Next Thursday 'cause I knew if we we.... a gentleman oh hey John Carlo I have

You can only put 20% down OK how do you find out if it's Fannie Mae approved my advice to you before you go show them once we figure out that number what they can qualify for always call the listing agent if the listing agent doesn't know call the management company you don't want to waste not that it's a waste of time but condos have gotten harder and if it's not family approved we're gonna have a problem and then they gotta put twenty percent down that's my job to explain it to him i'm just telling you when you find the listings we find out what they are OK so wait pata.


Most companies have that and what that is they'll go in and see a room like this and the camera will take it all every all of you out everything out of this room and then decorate it and so when you put it on the multiple if you can put the real picture and but then you put virtual staging because most people don't see they're not creative yeah they can't see it so the virtual staging does work in that sense you must buy the real estate law by MLS law put that it is virtually staged so people understand that it's not the way it really looks right Let me just make some more copy of this I have the housekeeper once after she was cleaning and I was checking it was mess OK I was explaining her like like what's what's this like why why do but for her it was normal and after a time once I was nearby where she was leaving my housekeeper and she told me like come come I am making a coffee for you I just entering her house and she was living with 9 cats and for her the apartment was tied up because she was living with nine cats it was normal I can't even imagine the smells Smells yeah no no my my house key park making the apartment I was checking that it was messed for me It was not tied up normal and after time I went in her house and she was living with 9 cats and imagine where
 and imagine where and imagine Where

 For 45 days or 60 days that buyer I guarantee you when you're out with your buyers one of the questions I'll be shocked if you don't get this question one of the buyers will say how long has this house been on the market The psychology behind that is they want to know how long the house has been on the market so they figure they can make a lower offer right and if it's on the market for one day or 2 days or a week they're not inclined to make a lower offer right so that in that respect staging helps you get more money 'cause it gets a sooner offer so it's not directly getting you but indirectly it gets you more money without a doubt So you have to get ready everything before you put in the listing to post it on that's why you have an Office exclusiveo. 

 make DOM shorter. get ready to go off. or office exclusive. 

 At least she hasn't been doing that this just directly between the homeowner and the stager as through the agreement they make whether they get paid out of the proceeds of the house or they get paid up front But staggers do help a lot I mean they're they're amazing you know and it does help the house help with it there's no doubt in my mind and so does it get more money not necessarily but it does in a roundabout way so they take furniture out of new furniture energy out some it depends on what it needs you know it could it could mean that they just rearrange the furniture you know I had one house where was it charming colonial in Glen Rock and they had the couch in front of the fireplace The back of the couch wasn't sitting in front of the fireplace so the stager of course removed everything did it there was must have been a reason they had that IIII don't know why but anyway so they may move furniture around they may bring in items paintings they may I mean some have even painted the kitchen cabinet have the kitchen cabinets painted paint the house all kinds of things everything everything that you can think of they'll do Yeah it was pretty crazy to see it like transform completely was it amazing yeah which which house was it it's the condo in Englewood Yeah it came out really nice It it's it's amazing what they they can do they have all kinds of resources from painters to even wallpaper you know wallpaper is making a huge comeback huge I don't recommend anybody recommending it 'cause it could go away tomorrow you know but but so many so many you know colors of changing one of the guys in this class had a house in closer and it was it was a really lovely Greek family I loved him he was an attorney the wife was delightful every room in their house was a different color turquoise turquoise right turquoise this color turquoise was their family room the dining room was red the living room was like an orange color it was great colors but it was insane you know so he had to have the whole house paint it because we felt that that wasn't going to appeal you know we went through this of neutral neutral neutral Zen neutral I think we're coming out of it I think a little bit more color is coming back into the world which I'm happy to see but but for a while if you didn't have you know the creamiest white walls you know white kitchen cabinets Granite was out courts is in you know if you didn't have all that you were dated you were out of style but now I think colors coming back again I see I see it coming back so what you have to be aware of is that all of your buyers are looking at these magazines the home decorating magazines that's what they're looking at and that's what they expect when they see a house which is that's why it's so shocking when they don't find out right so look into those magazines and see what you see because you'll know where your buyers heads are coming from you know it makes a big differenceu

 Feel you have to handle it even if it's the listing brokers obligation or the attorneys obligation so many times they fall flat and you can't trust them so you got to make sure that your at least you do a reminder OK now one O8 when Wendy does here she does this a little bit differently everybody has a different way of doing things but I sat with an attorney on this and on line 108 paragraph six it says items included in the sale and there is 15 16 and 17 lines for you to add that I am very very specific on that some people put as per listing agreement so on the listing if it says we are including our first born son the dining room chandelier you know whatever they're including you have to put it here if your person wants it you also have to be very specific what if they don't want it they're including the pool table in the family room Your customer doesn't want that pool table put that down they're very hard to get rid of by the way So put that down there that you know the customer does not want the pool table but why do you want to be why can't you put as per listing agreement Because legally that listing agreement that listing that you're reading is an offering to the public a private legal offering that if you are paying exactly what they're asking for all the terms that they're asking for those items are included but if it alters in any way shape or form if your customer makes a lower offer those things might not be included that violates that offering voids that offering rather and that so I am very very specific because if guys if you don't be very very specific and never Wendy when she comes will tell you put as per listing agreement don't listen to her I love her but don't listen to her she then she puts it in the additional contractual provisions she puts it more specifically I think that's a conflict I think that this lawyer was right he says be very specific if you're not specific you may wind paying for a dining room chandelier because you could get to the closing the homeowners left they took down their chandelier and the buyer said well where is the chandelier during the walkthrough and they say well wait a minute that was only if you paid full price So we're going to put everything that our buyers want in here step by step name by name planters outside garage door whatever they want even if it's not included in the listing what if they say hey we'll buy this house if they leave all the all the drapes in the living room that wasn't mentioned in the listing so the purchaser the the purchaser this contract is subject to the seller leaving the dining room or living room drapes whatever all of that should be in there very specific right once and not once once and not once right yes yes yes but I mean you can't be ridiculous like if there's a pool that they don't want the pool but I mean like yeah things that are not attached to the house yeah right dates and times of performance are very very again very specific it's going to tell you that the contract is required by applicable law including but not limited to if the closing has to be delayed either because the lender does not timely provide documents through no fault of the buyer or seller or for 3 business days because of the change of terms as required by the Consumer Financial Protection seller agree that the dates and times included this contract this is a

 it was never there before it's only been there for a couple of years it puts time is of the essence you know in that 1st line Selena and Brian that all dates and times included in this contract are of the essence what does that mean anybody know Time is of the essence I'm sorry like to stick to those dates like that they want them that those dates are carved in stone those are important dates years ago the lawyers would only put time is of the essence on the contract after it was beyond the date so if it didn't close on November 1st they would put time is of the essence or what is today the 4th or 3rd if it doesn't close it's supposed to close today didn't close the lawyer would put time is of the essence and the people would have 10 days to be able to close they would have those 10 days unless everybody agreed to extend it longer but it would be times of the essence was for 10 days to perform right so now they put it right in the contract so they have to perform or not perform or get an extension right mutually agreed upon extension very very important OK so that's why this paragraph makes it even more important for you to use because I use this because I'm always having it with me it where a date is put in here with a timer and it reminds me of you that on the 30th of December this closing is going to take place and So what you do is on the on the 25th of the well not Christmas Day but somewhere in December you make sure that your CO is done that you're you're doing your walkthroughs that everything is in order you know and and every every step of the way of this contract that date that they put is time is of the essence you should remember you can't forget it how do you set dates like you know I see they they're they're in this contract this day this must be done this day how do you mean spreading this contract out make these dates up Well pretty much it defaults if you know if you read the contract it will say if you don't put anything in there it'll default to 10 days or 15 days no you don't have to if it defaults I do do it when I want to make the perfect contract so let's say today is what is today the 4th OK so I sell a house today and it's Wednesday and we have a three day attorney review I get it to the attorneys right away so Wednesday Thursday Friday can't count weekend so attorney review should be over on Monday right so that would be Monday and then that would be Monday would be the 11th and so the 10% or deposit should be due usually within so many days after attorney review if I want a really good solid contract I say I'm going to bring the 10% in the day after attorney review or the day we go into under contract So I would say 10% do that's your deposit it could i'm just using that number by the way it could be 5% it could be 7 10:00 203040 it could be anything It could actually be the whole price put into escrow that's how it could that's how flexible it could be so let's say your person is going for a $200,000 unit and they're getting $100,000 mortgage So there's 200,000 there's 100,000 in cash you know and normally then it would be 20,000 down as 10% and then the balance at closing they could put the whole $100,000 down right then and there to go in through the attorneys escrow if they want that would make a beautiful contract you wouldn't even have to worry about proof of funds right So it depends that depends so I would put that but whatever it is I would put it coming in immediately not within the 10 day you know. The next would be the mortgage So on the next line it would say you know that the person would apply for a mortgage within and again I think it defaults to something like 10 days I say the in additional contractual provisions and on the contract person will apply for their mortgage imm OK yeah but those but anything you do hereediately home inspections immediately Now just right away just pick a date right away and then title work to use regency title what did I say about regency title even if the deal falls through because they didn't get their mortgage or there was something wrong in the home inspection they won't charge them but apply for it immediately that way you could have a three way closing by the way and then the typical time for a mortgage is 30 days but pack and do it faster but I would put 30 days normally especially if you don't know the mortgage broker right and then the bank needs to review the paperwork for three days prior to closing so you put the date of closing would be maybe 35 days Do do we use a closing date from the pre approval usually II believe free approvals have like a closing date I think so sometimes they do sometimes they don't no I would use it from the date it goes under contract

OK yeah but those but anything you do here is is what So so those dates can be amended they can be changed whatever and that is is those dates are important but once the lawyer reviews it and solidifies those dates make sure they're there you're going to be reminding of those those timelines Especially since this paragraph was put in where the contract is time is of the essence The buyer selects as the title company most times we don't know who the title company is and since I like our title company and there are benefits to our buyers and to us And by the way all title companies charge the same it's regulated there's no shopping for fees it's all regulated so so I put in regency title and then the lawyer wants to change that he can OK they also by the way for this transaction if they're if if even if they're not your title company and you think that there's something like Miranda was talking about the floodplain thing she can call them and they'll say yes in the floodplain it's in the hundred it's the one whatever they'll do that they will also give you AA quick search of the property let's say you're listing a property it looks like it's you know you're not sure that it isn't I don't mean flood wise but I mean underwater that it's less it's worth less than what they owe on it you know that there could be a problem it could be a short sale or foreclosure or something they will look into the title see how many liens they're on to see if no charge to you see if there's enough capital enough funds to close the property Why is that important to you you want your Commission right you want to be paid there's not enough money to pay you there's not enough money to pay you But what's another thing that could happen So you have the listing you take it you don't know any of this You never and another realtor calls you and asks you what you're paying out What's the compensation you say I'm paying you 2% OK it closes There's not enough money to pay them Could a court decide you had an obligation to tell them that ma'am Yeah so be very careful and that's why Regency is important so for all of us we have the right to call them they will do a quick search to protect us right OK let's go municipal assessments





Here and we go OK items include dates for performance title up times of the Essence the CEO what is it so not every town has a certificate of occupancy So Ridgewood doesn't which I'm really shocked that has no but it does have a fire certification Fairlawn has a rigid rigid one that that inspector she is a nightmare she goes through everything and you know it's it's amazing But anyway she even measures the height of the steps going in and out of the house you know so she's really tough but so some do some don't so basically it is as a listing agent it's your job to notify the seller that they need ACO or the fire certification or both and so they should call the town and set up the appointment All right it's your job to make sure they do it And then it's your job as a buyer's agent to make sure that they did i've gone to I've been on a walk through when the the seller's agent nor did the seller ever get ACO we had a she had a rush and get it so we could meet the closing date thank God I asked where was the CEO so now I make it a practice of after I did that happened to me I make it a practice to require you know you would think the attorney for the buyer would have said do you have your CEO where is it I don't have it because both the title company and the attorney want to see it Guess what you won't close without it Water bill another thing has to be paid you won't close without it in some towns So and the other thing you want to make sure of years ago we could do this I used to call for my buyers to register them for their you know electricity their water their you know gas and electric but and turn it off for the seller but now they don't let you do that anymore the seller has to do it and the buyer has to do it why it makes sense I could not like you today and I'm going to call up the PSE and G and turn off your heat right I mean that's what I used to do it used to be able to call turn it on turn it off everything's fine change not not anymore so those are important things how much your buyer has to do with moving and transferring furniture transferring bank accounts cards license registering in the town whatever they have to do they may not think about their PSE and G What I tell my seller is to always give another day or so even though they're paying another day it would be nice it's not a lot of money so if you're closing on Monday you know keep it open until Wednesday or Thursday in case of a delay what I tell my my my my that's my sellers what I tell my buyers is to make sure that they call and have it turned on for the for the day they usually can't get it turned on unless the seller calls to disrupt it So you have to stay on top of that that's very important you don't want a family with a young baby moving into a cold house right no heat no electricity whatever very important these are the little things Yeah these are the little things you're not going to learn in a in a you know in a regular training class but there are the important things because they're the things that will endear you to your buyers and sellers because you're on top of everything you know municipal assessments you this is something you would last the listing broker have there been any assessments what's your municipal assessment the town is assessing each house on 4th Street for a new sidewalk right so you have to let them know whether there is or there isn't quality of the title the title must be according to this contract insurable by a title company OK that's an easy one OK on line 186 this paragraph is just basically saying rezoning of this house so this is a one family home residential dwelling or a 2 family or a multi use whatever you know whatever you're selling and then if it is a two family it has possession occupancy and tenants you have to put the tenants name the location the rent the security deposit and the term security deposit very very very important you you must remind your buyers that they should be handed over the security department because lawyers forget about this the security deposit for each tenancy you want to know why Because most landlords don't abide by it not most but a lot don't abide by it they don't take that security deposit and put it into a tenant security account at a bank And you know what the fine is for it if they don't three times the security deposit And let's say you close on that house and they didn't give you the security deposit and two years passes and the tenants leaving and you have no security deposit you can be liable for three times that security deposit so if it was $2000 it's now $6000 so be very careful with that and remind them you want the security deposit OK lead based paint you know when you when you when you start a contract start a you know on the listing this will have these little box here with documents and you hit it and comes down usually lead based paint document sellers property disclosure document sometimes a survey if you're lucky and all those instruments will be there so you can upload those into your zip forms and most of the time it says that these seller has no knowledge of lead based paint and it's only for houses built prior to yeah prior to 1978 yeah OK lead warning I don't know anybody in my 40 years I don't know anybody who did a lead test because it's like there's like paint it was built before that that year there's lead paint so and here is the great O inspection OK So read that paragraph it just goes on about the inspection and when and here again it said how many days the seller shall have and Left Bank blank then three business days and there's all kinds of dates on here that also have a default if they're left blank and then the rental inspection again same thing for a two family this is again something relatively new the seller is advised to provide the buyer with all lead safe certifications concerning the property and the guide to lead Base paint in rental Dwellings issued by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs prior to closing all two families now all rental two families must be inspected every two years for lead paint and if the limb if the tenant leaves in one year it has to be inspected again so so that all has to be done and if you're listing a two family you need the lead paint certification the landlord has to get a lead paint certification and give it to you to give to the to be available for the new tenant I would take that lead paint certification and put it as one of the documents in a 2 family home I know that most landlords have no knowledge of this a lot of them don't but make sure you advise them and let them know because they can be sued if they don't do it right before 1917 yeah after they don't need no and this certificate they get once and they have they they will keep it We knew every two years or upon a new tenant coming in and if if they made once and there is no lead OK so it's so there are two certifications OK 1 is a little bit less it's less expensive and but it has to be done every two years 1 is a where they really take plugs in the wall to see if there is any lead if there's no lead you get a it goes forever but the likelihood is as the lead inspector told me that any house prior to that date has led somewhere in those layers of paint it could be 10 layers under but it's there yeah so the the major problem with it is woodwork that's cracked or something or windows opening and closing if there's like usually new replacement windows no problems But old old windows when they open they somehow shed layers of paint sometimes that's where the damage is OK I know it's 130 guys but I have got to fit we've got to finish this baby OK cesspool point of entry treatment poet system is just a filtration system that is placed where the water comes into the house OK and you have to notify you have to know about that where it is especially if it's well water because if they're going to be testing it cesspool is a old old style of septic tank that is not approved anymore if they or they do exist but they you cannot transfer title with one so if you sell a house that has a cesspool it has to be replaced with a new septic system prior to closing And basically here it says that the seller agrees to change it and there is also an opportunity for the buyer to agree to change it to into a septic why would you want to do that it might be an old historic home he's going to tear down the property and put up a new home so he has the right to do that inspection contingency clause this goes over everything radon testing that's for that gas that gets crapped it's everywhere radon by the way but it gets trapped in basements because of all the good insulation we have OK on line D is does anybody really have to leave at this moment You have to run OK but you've gone through this already OK buyer's right to inspection this is where it defaults to a left blank fourteen calendar days that's a long time So in other words they're saying that you have the right to inspection you have 14 days to get an inspection I always tighten that have the inspection done right away you can have it done as soon as the attorney review is over you know it's important that it be done right away because makes a homeowner happy because when you tighten up all those dates right it doesn't extend the closing date many people do if the homeowner lets you responsibility to cure then again there's these days that go back and forth I leave them alone Flood risk again that that's just it's hello that really has nothing to do with anything except what the you can go on you can go on Realist and find it you can go to our title company you can you can look at what you know all the different sites here's another there's two sites here about flood risks flood hazard area And you can research that the difference between a flood hazard and a flood risk and the problem is the mortgage broker may require the person and they they not may they will require them to purchase flood insurance But you can do what Mariah did and call the neighborhood said how bad was it did you really flood blah blah blah blah blah you know the the qualification of the inspectors it can't be your Uncle Harry it has to be a real qualified inspector it can't be just somebody pull out of the street otherwise it doesn't work border quality again if it's on a well specifically the homeowners responsibility is to have the wealth water test it OK Megan's Law do we all know what Megan's Law Pretty much OK Megan's law is very very specific and you may not indicate to any buyer your knowledge of a pedophile which I think it has its good and bad points but you can there is there is a registry that this contract points them to so if they read this contract they can see the buyers notified that new jersey establishes an Internet registry of sex offenders that may be accessed at WWW neither the seller nor any real estate broker or salesperson may .

www.njsp.orange

Then to a registry and whether it's accurate or not we don't know because people move you know notification of off site conditions again this is where you can research that air safety notice that's not important really it's just where planes are going overhead right bulk sales that doesn't apply to us It's really about withholding tax for anybody leaving the country notice to buyer and seller concerning insurance very very important you may have a lot of and this is where things fall through the crack you may have a lot of people who are buying all cash it's happening a lot lately I don't know where they're getting all the money from but they are and they forget to get insurance if you're getting a mortgage they the bank demands you get insurance so if you're buying Wolcott's remind your buyers look I know you're buying all cash there'll be nobody out there reminding you to insure the property I do know somebody that that happened to me really So II bought a house in Florida I had a mortgage I paid off the mortgage and the bank is not there to remind me anymore so now it's hard for me to get insurance because I went almost a year without it so now I had to pay for all this type of inspection so now it is inspection they're finding things so it's like I used to pay 1500 bucks now they want like five grand 'cause they just found out my roof is old that this is all'cause I had to get like a viewpoint inspection so I'm still without insurance because in Florida now it hurricane season yeah so I can't even get insurance right now to self insure basically yeah my kids are off my husband's got to go to work are they off for an election day OK you know what i'm going to stop...

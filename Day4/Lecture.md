## Decision Makers and Client Dynamics

### The Complete Decision-Making Unit

**Core Principle:** Always identify and include ALL decision-makers from the start

#### Primary Scenario: Spouse/Partner Involvement
```
Agent approach: "I wouldn't be able to go to see a house without my wife.
Would you want to have your wife/husband come along?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Non-threatening question format
- Shows respect for family dynamics
- Prevents wasted showings and re-decisions
- Usually the wife picks the house (statistically)

#### Secondary Scenario: Parental Involvement

**Red Flag Statement:**
> "My parents are lending us the money and they want to come see the house."

**Problem:**
- Parents almost always think the house is overpriced
- They talk young buyers out of offers
- Creates additional showing cycles and delays

**Solution Strategy:**
1. **Include parents from the beginning:** "If your parents are involved in the purchase, let's have them come with us."
2. **Treat parents as allies, NOT adversaries:** "It's really great that you're helping your kids buy a home. This market is really hard to find a home, so I would encourage you to help us as much as you can."
3. **Get them involved:** Engage parents, make them part of the team

**Contrast with Car Sales:**
- Car dealerships: kick out "the lawyers" (friends giving advice)
- Real estate: CANNOT do this - must be inclusive and collaborative

#### Friends as Advisors

**Common Situation:** "My friend just bought a house down the street."
- Friends may attend showings to give advice
- This is less problematic than parents (usually)
- Engage them positively - they may be future clients

**Key Mindset Shift:**
- More people = more perspectives = better decisions
- Extra attendees = future referral opportunities
- Never treat additional people as obstacles

---

## Weather-Based Prospecting Strategy

### The Bad Weather Opportunity

**Core Strategy:** Make calls during bad weather when people are home and thinking about moving

#### Real Success Story - Circle Prospecting in Snow

**The Call:**
> Woman answers: "I can't believe this! My husband and I are sitting here having our breakfast coffee. We are so sick of this white [snow]. We want to get out of here!"

**Where are you going?**
> "Florida."

**Agent Response:**
> "OK, I have a friend in Florida. Let me have her send you some listings."

**Outcome:**
- Listed her house
- Got a referral fee from Florida agent
- All from ONE phone call during bad weather

### Advanced Weather Strategy

**Proactive Prospecting:**
1. **Identify communities** you want to work in
2. **Use Remine to filter** for elderly homeowners (25-30 years in home, mortgage paid off)
3. **During snow storms:** Go help elderly homeowners shovel snow
   - They will remember you forever
   - Builds genuine relationship
   - When they're ready to sell, you're the obvious choice

**Important Balance:**
> "That's being creative... but the calls are still more important. How are you going to find that little old lady? We're going to know how to do it tomorrow in Remine."

---

## Remine Platform for Lead Generation

### What Remine Can Do

**Powerful Filtering Capabilities:**
- **Time in home:** 20, 25, 30+ years
- **Mortgage status:** Paid off or nearly paid off
- **Sell score:** Analytics predict readiness to sell based on online behavior
- **Activity tracking:** Looking at Florida listings, retirement communities, etc.

**Cost:** Company pays for it through MLS membership
- Available in: New Jersey MLS, Garden State MLS
- NOT available in: Hudson County MLS (probably), Vermont
- **Solution if not available:** Use your manager's MLS access (they belong to all multiples)

### Using Remine for Farming

**Old Method:**
- Mail to every single house in a geographic area
- Waste money on people who just moved in or aren't ready

**New Method with Remine:**
1. **Filter for high-probability sellers:**
   - Long-term homeowners
   - High sell scores
   - Specific demographics (elderly, paid-off mortgages)
2. **Refine your list** to 250+ ideal prospects
3. **Focus marketing budget** on high-probability targets

**Still maintain some geographic coverage** to catch:
- Recent divorces (moved in 1 year ago)
- Sudden life changes
- Unexpected sellers

**Training Available:**
- Remine seminar on Platform Academy (online)
- Sammy's training session (goes fast, but comprehensive)
- Spell: **R-E-M-I-N-E** (like "mining" for leads)

## Rental Requirements and Dr. Varus

### Rental Application Process

**Dr. Varus System:**
- Credit reporting system for rental applications
- Used to be multiple systems, now consolidated into one

**Who Must Apply:**
- Every adult (18, 20, 21+) living in the house
- All adults must be on the lease
- All adults must be qualified

### Credit Check Process

1. **Agent does credit check** through Dr. Varus (or Docuvera Online)
2. **Present to landlord** with application
3. **Landlord does conditional acceptance** based on credit
4. **If landlord insists:** Criminal history check through Dr. Varus

### Criminal History Requirements

**Important Landlord Warnings:**

**Liability if NO criminal history check:**
- If tenant injures somebody → Landlord could be liable
- If tenant makes drugs in the house → Landlord could be liable
- **Recommendation:** Mental health history too (but not currently done)

**Who is liable if something happens?**
- Landlord is primarily liable
- Dr. Varus provides the service
- Agent facilitates but is not liable for screening

**Balance:**
- Must follow Attorney General's memorandum (no discrimination)
- But landlords can be held responsible for dangerous tenants
- Criminal check protects landlord from liability

---

## Buyer Qualification Questions

### Question #7: "If you owned a business..."

**Full Question:**
> "If you owned a business, would it be a good idea for me to establish what the value of your home is before we move forward?"

**Purpose:**
- Subtle way to discuss listing their current home
- Not directly taking the listing
- Just "establishing value"
- Opens conversation about selling before buying

**Why It Works:**
- Business analogy makes it professional
- Non-threatening approach
- Logical sequence (value → decision → action)

---

## MLS Prospecting and Safe Search

### Setting Up Buyer in MLS Prospecting

**Process:**
1. **Add client to MLS prospecting system**
2. **Fill out their criteria:** Bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc.
3. **Keep criteria BROAD initially** to capture more options
4. **Ask preference:** "Would you like to receive listings in real time, or would you prefer once a week?"

### The Safe Search Intelligence

**What Buyers Can Do:**
- Search for homes themselves through portal
- See all listings that match criteria
- Write notes on listings
- Save favorites

**What YOU Can See:**
- **Everything they search for** - even outside their stated budget
- **Example:** They tell you $700K budget, but search $900K homes
- **This reveals their TRUE budget**

**How to Use This Information:**
> "By the way, I saw your search. Is there anything in that price range you would like to see?"

**Be honest and transparent** - acknowledge you can see their searches

### Real-World Example: Rafael's Mistake

**The Situation:**
- Rafael had buyer clients (husband and wife, both work hard)
- He thought: "I don't want to disturb them, they work very hard"
- **His strategy:** Only send listings at 6:00 PM after they get home

**The Problem:**
> Wife called: "I don't understand this. How come I can see it on Zillow before you send it to me?"

**The Lesson:**
- She wanted REAL-TIME notifications
- She never asked for delayed sending
- **Always ask what they prefer**
- Don't make assumptions about their preferences

### Buyer Communication Preferences - ASK These Questions

1. **"Do you want listings in real time, or would you prefer once a week?"**
2. **"If there's anything you like, give me a call and I'll make an appointment."**
3. **"How would you like me to work with you?"**
4. **"When is the best time to call you?"**

**Permission-Based Communication:**
- Permission to call them
- Permission to show houses
- Permission to work a certain way
- **When you get permission, people understand and appreciate your system**

---

## Buyer Communication Preferences

### The Over-Aggressive Agent Story

**Client's Experience:**
> "He was on the ball. He was too aggressive. I was afraid if I hit [a listing button], he's gonna call me in 5 minutes. I wouldn't even open them. I wouldn't even see the listings because I know I was gonna get a call - like three calls right back."

**The Problem:**
- Agent didn't ask about communication preferences
- Agent assumed everyone wants immediate follow-up
- Client felt pressured and avoided engaging

**The Solution:**
> "You should have told him: 'Do me a favor - could you only call me on Fridays?'"

**But the real issue:** Agent should have asked upfront:
- "How would you like me to work with you?"
- "When's the best time to call?"
- "Do you prefer text, email, or phone calls?"

### Market Context for Communication

**In Hot Markets (like recent):**
- Most buyers WANT immediate notification
- They want real-time alerts
- They want aggressive follow-up
- Speed = opportunity

**Important:** Don't assume - ASK each client what they want

---

## Showing Feedback Protocol

### The Annoying Seller

**Common Problem:**
- Seller's house gets shown
- Seller calls immediately: "What did they say?"
- Agent's response: "They haven't even gotten home yet. They haven't even gotten out the door."

**Why Sellers Do This:**
- Excited about their home being shown
- Want information immediately
- Don't understand the feedback process

### The Professional Solution

**Set Expectations Up Front:**
> "I will give you feedback on all of the showings once I get it, and I'll call you every Thursday."

**Benefits:**
- One organized feedback call per week
- Time for agents to actually provide feedback
- Reduces anxiety and repeated calls
- Professional and systematic

### Agent Responsibility: GIVE Feedback

**After Every Showing:**
- You will get call or text from Showing Time or listing agent
- "Can you give me some feedback?"
- **They don't want YOUR feedback - they want your CUSTOMER'S feedback**

**What to Report:**
- "Kitchen was outdated"
- "Too much money for the square footage"
- "Loved the layout but needs updating"
- Honest, constructive feedback

**Why Give Good Feedback:**
- You're helping them (and future buyers)
- Someday you may need their help
- Professional courtesy
- **Never have an argument with another agent** (no matter how rude)

**If Agent is Rude:**
> "Gee, I'm very sorry you feel that way."
That's it. Move on.

## Price Range Discovery Techniques

### Question #7: Indirect Price Discovery

**The Question:**
> "The home you called on is listed in the $900s. Is that the price range you're interested in?"

**Possible Responses:**
- **"Maybe that's a little high for us"** → Look lower
- **"No, we can really go a little higher"** → Look higher
- **"Yes, that's our range"** → Perfect, stay there

**Why This Works:**
- Doesn't directly ask "how much can you spend?"
- Uses the listing they called on as reference
- Natural conversation flow
- Non-threatening approach

### The $400K vs $900K Story

**The Disaster:**
- New agent gets call on $400K listing
- Agent prepares thoroughly - sees every $400K home
- Shows up prepared for $400K showings

**The Shock:**
- Buyer shows up: Wife in gorgeous mink coat, driving Mercedes
- Husband has newspaper with circles around properties
- **All circled properties are in the $900s**

**Agent's Response:**
> "She almost collapsed."

**The Recovery:**
- Instructor was there to help
- Asked: "Why did you call on a $400K when you can spend this much?"
- Buyer: "Well, I was just wondering what you could get for $400K. Just out of curiosity."

**The Lesson:**
- **Always ask about price range BEFORE showing**
- Don't assume based on initial inquiry
- If you don't ask, you'll look unprepared
- It will show on your face

---

## Buyer Needs Assessment

### Question #8: "Were there any other homes or ads that interested you?"

**Why Ask This:**
- **Not everyone knows you can show every home in New Jersey**
- Buyers think they need different agents for different listings

### Why Buyers Don't Know About Universal Showing

**Regional Differences:**
- **New York:** NO centralized MLS that works properly
- Different neighborhoods = different brokerages with exclusive listings
- Hell's Kitchen, Upper East Side, Village, Soho, Noho = separate listings
- Buyers had to go to multiple brokers

**New Jersey System:**
- **Forced multiple listing system**
- EVERY listing must be shared
- EVERY listing (even office exclusives) must be in MLS within 24 hours
- One agent can show ANY property in the state

### MLS Requirements and Compliance

**24-Hour Rule:**
- All listings must be in MLS within 24 hours
- This includes: Office exclusives, pocket listings, everything
- **Non-compliance = huge fine**

**Attorney Review Reporting:**
- When contract goes to attorney review → Report immediately
- **Why:** Some brokers don't report it to keep showing the house
- **Problem:** You try to show it, they say "can't be shown"
- **Result:** You look foolish to your buyer

**Under Contract Reporting:**
- Must report immediately when under contract
- Must report closing date immediately
- **If closing delayed beyond a couple days:** Update closing date in MLS

**This is about fair and equitable treatment** - all agents deserve current information

---

## Question #9: Most Important Features

**The Question:**
> "What are the most important features you're looking for?"

**Why This Can Be Very Specific:**
- "I need a huge backyard because my kids play soccer"
- "I need a huge backyard for football or baseball"
- Specific sports requirements
- Specific lifestyle needs

**The Dream Home Reality:**
- Buyers will give you their DREAM home wish list
- **Reality:** No house will have EVERYTHING
- Your job: Prioritize their needs vs wants
- Help them understand trade-offs

**Use This Information:**
- Narrow your search to homes that fit top 3-5 priorities
- Don't waste time on homes missing critical features
- Set expectations about what's available vs what's desired

---

## Condo Qualification and Fannie Mae Approval

### The Condo Problem

**Scenario:** Buyer is qualified and can only put 20% down

**Agent's Job BEFORE Showing:**
1. **Call the listing agent:** "Is this condo Fannie Mae approved?"
2. **If listing agent doesn't know:** Call the management company
3. **If NOT Fannie Mae approved:** Buyer must put 20% down

**Why This Matters:**
- Condos have gotten harder to finance
- If not Fannie Mae approved = limited financing options
- **Don't waste time showing if buyer can't qualify**

**Whose Job:**
> "That's my job to explain it to them [the buyer]. I'm just telling you when you find the listings, find out what they are."

---

## Virtual Staging and Marketing

### What is Virtual Staging?

**The Process:**
1. Camera takes photo of empty room
2. Software removes everything
3. Software "decorates" the room virtually with furniture, art, decor
4. Upload both real photo AND virtually staged photo to MLS

**Why It Works:**
- Most people aren't creative - they can't visualize
- Empty rooms look smaller and less appealing
- Staged photos help buyers see potential

**Legal Requirement:**
> "You MUST by real estate law, by MLS law, put that it is virtually staged so people understand it's not the way it really looks."

### The Perception Problem Story

**The Housekeeper Story:**
- Instructor had housekeeper cleaning house
- After cleaning, instructor checked - house was a mess
- Instructor explains to housekeeper this isn't clean
- **Housekeeper's response:** For her, this WAS normal

**The Revelation:**
- Instructor visits housekeeper's home
- Housekeeper: "Come, come! I'm making coffee for you!"
- **Housekeeper was living with 9 CATS**
- For someone living with 9 cats, the client's "messy" house WAS tidy

**The Lesson:**
- Everyone has different standards of "clean" and "presentable"
- What looks good to seller may not appeal to buyers
- Staging and professional photography create universal appeal
- Can't rely on seller's perception of what looks good

---

## Days on Market (DOM) Strategy

### Buyer Psychology and DOM

**The Inevitable Question:**
> "How long has this house been on the market?"

**Why Buyers Ask:**
- If house has been on market 45-60+ days → They want to make lower offer
- If house is on market 1-2 days or 1 week → They're not inclined to make lower offer

### How Staging Reduces DOM

**The Connection:**
1. Staged home looks better
2. Better photos attract more buyers immediately
3. More showings in first week
4. Faster offers
5. **Shorter DOM = more money indirectly**

**The Staging Paradox:**
> "Does staging get you more money? Not directly. But indirectly it gets you more money without a doubt."

### Office Exclusive Strategy

**The Pre-Launch Strategy:**
1. **Take listing but don't launch to MLS yet** (office exclusive)
2. **Get everything ready:**
   - Professional photos
   - Virtual staging
   - Marketing materials
   - Showing schedule ready
3. **Launch when 100% ready** - goes on MLS Day 1, fully prepared
4. **Result:** Shorter DOM, better first impression, faster offers

**Why This Works:**
- You want DOM to be as short as possible
- First impression is everything
- Can't "re-launch" a listing
- Staging before launch = immediate impact

## Home Staging Benefits

### What Professional Stagers Do

**Comprehensive Services:**
- **Rearrange existing furniture**
- **Remove furniture** (if too much or wrong style)
- **Bring in new furniture** (rental)
- **Add paintings, decor, accessories**
- **Paint kitchen cabinets**
- **Paint entire house**
- **Add wallpaper** (making huge comeback)
- **Complete transformations**

### The Couch-in-Front-of-Fireplace Story

**The Problem:**
- Charming colonial in Glen Rock
- Sellers had couch positioned with BACK facing fireplace
- Blocked the view of the fireplace feature

**The Solution:**
- Stager removed everything
- Repositioned furniture properly
- Fireplace became focal point

**Mystery:**
> "There must have been a reason they had it that way... I don't know why."

### The Turquoise House Story

**The Listing:**
- Lovely Greek family (attorney husband, delightful wife)
- House in [location]

**The Problem:**
- **Family room:** TURQUOISE
- **Dining room:** RED
- **Living room:** ORANGE
- Every room was a different bold color

**The Solution:**
- Had to paint entire house
- Went neutral throughout
- **Reasoning:** "Great colors, but insane. Not going to appeal to buyers."

### Current Design Trends

**The Neutral Era (Past Several Years):**
- Creamiest white walls
- White kitchen cabinets
- Granite OUT, Quartz IN
- Zen, neutral, minimal
- "If you didn't have all that, you were dated"

**The New Trend:**
> "I think color is coming back again. I see it coming back."

**Agent Responsibility:**
- **Look at home decorating magazines** - that's what buyers are looking at
- That's what buyers expect to see
- Magazines show you where buyers' heads are
- Staging should reflect current trends

## Contract Line 108: Items Included in Sale

### The "As Per Listing Agreement" Problem

**Common Shortcut (WRONG WAY):**
- Line 108 says "Items included in the sale"
- Agent writes: "As per listing agreement"

**Why This Is DANGEROUS:**

#### The Legal Issue

**The listing is "an offering to the public":**
- A private legal offering
- **IF buyer pays exactly asking price + all terms → Items ARE included**
- **IF offer alters in ANY way (lower price, different terms) → Offering is VOIDED**
- Items may NOT be included anymore

#### The Attorney's Advice

**Instructor sat with attorney on this:**
> "I am very, very specific on that line. Be very specific. If you're not specific, you may wind up paying for a dining room chandelier."

**Why:**
- Listing agreement becomes void if terms change
- Items listed were only guaranteed at full price
- Changed terms = changed deal

### The Right Way: Be Extremely Specific

**List Everything Separately:**
1. Dining room chandelier
2. Kitchen appliances (list each one)
3. Window treatments in [specific rooms]
4. Garage door opener
5. Pool table in family room (if they want it)
6. Planters outside
7. **Everything - even if in listing**

**Special Note - Pool Table:**
> "Your customer doesn't want that pool table, put that down there. They're very hard to get rid of, by the way."

**Statement:** "The customer does NOT want the pool table in family room."

### What If They Want Items NOT in Listing?

**Example:**
> "Hey, we'll buy this house if they leave all the drapes in the living room."

**Solution:**
- Even though NOT in listing agreement
- **Add to Line 108:** "This contract is subject to the seller leaving the living room drapes."

**Rule:**
> "All of that should be in there, very specific. Once and not once."

**"Once and not once"?**
- List specific items that ARE included
- List specific items that are NOT included

### Wendy's Different Approach (Instructor Disagrees)

**Wendy's Method:**
- Put "as per listing agreement" on Line 108
- Then specify items in "Additional Contractual Provisions" section

**Instructor's View:**
> "I love her, but don't listen to her. I think that's a conflict."

**Reason for Disagreement:**
- Line 108 is the PROPER place for items included
- Additional provisions creates conflicting locations
- Attorney said Line 108 should be specific
- Don't risk confusion or conflict

### What Can Be Ridiculous

**Example of Going Too Far:**
> "You can't be ridiculous. Like if there's a pool that they don't want the pool."

**Clarification:**
- Don't list things attached to the house that obviously stay
- Focus on **things not attached to the house** or ambiguous items
- Appliances, fixtures, decorations, outdoor items

**Important Distinction:**
- Attached = stays (usually)
- Not attached = specify if wanted or not wanted

---

## Dates and Times of Performance

### Lines 1-5: Time is of the Essence

**Critical Contract Language:**
> "Seller and Buyer agree that all dates and times included in this contract are of the essence."

### What "Time is of the Essence" Means

**Old Meaning (Years Ago):**
- Lawyers would add "time is of the essence" AFTER a missed closing date
- Example: Closing was November 1st, didn't happen
- Lawyer adds "time is of the essence" = 10 more days to close
- Either close in 10 days OR get mutual extension

**New Meaning (Current Contracts):**
- **"Time is of the essence" is now IN the contract from Day 1**
- Every date is carved in stone
- Every date is an important date
- Must perform OR get mutual extension

### Critical Dates Paragraph

**Contract states:**
> "Dates and times of performance are very specific. This contract is subject to seller agreeing that the dates and times included in this contract [are of the essence]."

**New Addition (Recent):**
- Wasn't in contracts before
- Only been there a couple of years
- Makes timing even more critical

### Why This Matters for Agents

**Your Responsibility:**
- Track EVERY date in the contract
- Set reminders for every deadline
- Can't forget ANY deadline

**Example Timeline:**
- Closing date: December 30th
- **Agent reminder:** Around December 25th (or before Christmas)
- **Check:**
  - Is C.O. done?
  - Walk-through scheduled?
  - Everything in order?

**The System:**
> "What you do is on the 30th of December, this closing is going to take place. So on the 25th of December... you make sure that your C.O. is done, that you're doing your walk-throughs, that everything is in order."

**Every deadline in contract:**
- Set reminder
- Don't rely on memory
- Check off when complete
- Follow up proactively

---

## Dates and Times of Performance (continued)

### Default Timelines

**If Dates Left Blank:**
- Most dates default to 10 or 15 days
- Attorney review: 3 business days
- Inspection: 14 calendar days (if blank)
- Other provisions have their own defaults

**Instructor's Approach:**
> "I leave them alone [the defaults]. I do do it when I want to make the perfect contract."

### Creating the "Perfect Contract" Timeline

**Start Date:** Today (Wednesday, example: November 4th)

**Attorney Review:**
- Contract signed today (Wednesday)
- 3 business days
- Can't count weekend
- **Attorney review ends:** Monday (November 11th)

**10% Deposit:**
- Due after attorney review ends
- **Instructor's preference:** Bring 10% immediately after attorney review OR day contract goes under contract
- Don't wait the default 10 days
- **Example date:** November 11th or 12th

**Important Note:**
> "It could be 5%, it could be 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%. It could actually be the whole price put into escrow."

**The $200K Unit Example:**
- Purchase price: $200,000
- Getting mortgage: $100,000
- Cash from buyer: $100,000
- **Standard:** $20,000 down as 10% deposit, balance at closing
- **"Perfect Contract" Option:** Put entire $100,000 in escrow immediately

**Why This Makes Perfect Contract:**
- No worries about proof of funds
- Shows serious commitment
- Eliminates financing concerns for that portion

### Mortgage Application Timeline

**Default:** 10 days to apply for mortgage

**Instructor's Preference:**
> "In additional contractual provisions... person will apply for their mortgage immediately."

**"Immediately" Means:**
- Apply for mortgage right away
- Don't wait the 10 days

### Home Inspection Timeline

**Default:** 14 days (if left blank)

**Instructor's Preference:**
> "Home inspections immediately. Apply for it immediately."

**"Immediately" Means:**
- Schedule inspection right away
- Don't wait the full 14 days

### Title Work Timeline

**Company:** Use Regency Title

**Timing:**
> "Apply for it immediately."

**Why Regency Title:**
- Even if deal falls through (no mortgage, failed inspection) → Won't charge
- Apply immediately so you can have 3-way closing

### Complete Timeline Strategy

**Standard Mortgage Timeline:** 30 days

**Instructor's Timeline:**
- **Mortgage approval:** 30 days (from contract date)
- **Lender review period:** 3 days before closing (required by law)
- **Closing date:** 35 days from contract date

**Reasoning:**
> "Bank needs to review the paperwork for 3 days prior to closing, so closing date would be maybe 35 days."

**Important Notes:**
- Pre-approval letters sometimes include closing date
- Usually agent sets timeline from contract date
- Use from date it goes under contract

---

## Title Company Selection - Regency Benefits

### Why Regency Title?

**Agent Benefits:**
1. **No charge if deal falls through:**
   - Buyer doesn't get mortgage → No charge
   - Failed home inspection → No charge
   - Contract cancelled → No charge
2. **Quick property research services** (free to agents)
3. **Title search services** before listing
4. **Fast turnaround** for 3-way closings

### Pre-Listing Title Search

**Scenario:** You're listing a property

**Concerns:**
- Looks like it might be underwater (worth less than owed)
- Could be short sale or foreclosure
- Need to know liens before listing

**Regency Service:**
- Will do quick title search
- See how many liens exist
- Determine if enough equity to close

**Why This Is Critical:**
- You want your commission
- You need to know if there's money to pay you
- **Court liability:** If you tell another agent "I'm paying 2%" but there's not enough money to pay them, court could decide YOU had obligation to tell them

**Protection:**
> "Be very careful. That's why Regency is important. For all of us we have the right to call them. They will do a quick search to protect us."

### Title Company Fees

**Regulated Pricing:**
> "All title companies charge the same. It's regulated. There's no shopping for fees."

**What This Means:**
- Using Regency costs buyer nothing extra
- Same price as any other title company
- But Regency offers extra benefits

### Contract Process

**Line in Contract:**
- "The buyer selects as the title company..."
- Most times we don't know who title company will be
- Instructor puts in "Regency Title"
- **Lawyer can change it if they want**

**Flexibility:**
- This is a starting point
- Attorney review can modify
- But starting with Regency gives buyer and agent best protection

### Services Available to All Agents

**Even if NOT your title company:**

1. **Flood plain questions:** "Yes, it's in the flood plain. It's in the 100-year flood zone."
2. **Property research:** Quick answers to title questions
3. **Lien searches:** How many liens, amounts, priorities

**Example from Miranda:**
- Had question about flood plain
- Called Regency even though not her title company
- Got immediate answer

**Free service** to all agents in the company

## Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.) Requirements

### What is a C.O.?

**Certificate of Occupancy:**
- Municipal certification that house meets code
- Required for legal occupancy
- Not all towns require it

### Which Towns Require C.O.?

**Towns WITHOUT C.O. Requirement:**
- **Ridgewood** (surprisingly) - BUT has fire certification instead

**Towns WITH Strict C.O. Requirements:**
- **Fairlawn:** "Rigid, rigid one. That inspector, she is a nightmare."
  - Goes through everything
  - Measures height of steps going in and out of house
  - "Really tough"

**Some towns require:**
- C.O.
- Fire certification
- Both

### Agent Responsibilities

#### As Listing Agent:

1. **Notify seller:** They need C.O. or fire certification (or both)
2. **Tell them to call the town:** Set up inspection appointment
3. **Make sure they do it:** Follow up that appointment is scheduled

#### As Buyer's Agent:

1. **Make sure seller DID get C.O.**
2. **Ask where C.O. is** during walk-through
3. **Verify C.O. is available** before closing

**Why This Matters:**
> "I've been on a walk-through when the seller's agent nor did the seller ever get a C.O. We had to rush and get it so we could meet the closing date. Thank God I asked where was the C.O."

### The New Practice - Always Ask

**Instructor's System:**
> "Now I make it a practice... after that happened to me, I make it a practice to require... [asking about C.O.]"

**Surprising Failures:**
- Attorney for buyer should ask
- Listing agent should ensure it's done
- **But often NO ONE asks**

**Critical Information:**
- Both title company AND attorney want to see C.O.
- **You won't close without it**
- Always verify it's complete before closing day

---

## Utility Transfer Management

### The Old System (No Longer Allowed)

**What Agents Used To Do:**
- Call PSE&G to register buyers for electricity
- Call to turn on water, gas, electric for buyers
- Call to turn OFF utilities for sellers
- Handled entire utility transfer process

**Why This Changed:**
> "Now they don't let you do that anymore. The seller has to do it and the buyer has to do it."

**Why the Change:**
- **Safety/liability issue:** "I could not like you today and I'm going to call up the PSE&G and turn off your heat."
- Anyone could call and shut off someone's utilities
- Created potential for harm

### Current Process

**Seller Must:**
- Call to disconnect utilities in their name
- Set date for utility shutoff
- Cannot be done by agent

**Buyer Must:**
- Call to connect utilities in their name
- Set date for utility connection
- Cannot be done by agent

### Agent's New Role: Reminder and Coordinator

**Problem:** Buyers have a lot on their mind:
- Moving and transferring furniture
- Transferring bank accounts
- Changing cards, licenses
- Registering in new town
- **They may forget about utilities**

### Timing Strategy

#### For Sellers:
> "Give another day or so even though they're paying another day. It would be nice. It's not a lot of money."

**Example:**
- Closing on Monday
- Keep utilities on until Wednesday or Thursday
- **Reason:** In case of closing delay

**Benefits:**
- Protects against last-minute delays
- Small extra cost for big protection
- Professional courtesy

#### For Buyers:

**Challenge:**
> "They usually can't get it turned on unless the seller calls to disrupt [disconnect] it."

**Solution:**
- Stay on top of the sequence
- Coordinate between buyer and seller
- Make sure seller disconnects first
- Then buyer can connect

### Critical Scenario to Avoid

**The Nightmare:**
> "You don't want a family with a young baby moving into a cold house. No heat, no electricity, whatever."

**Prevention:**
- Verify seller will disconnect day before or day of closing
- Verify buyer will connect immediately after
- Follow up with both parties
- Double-check a few days before closing

### The "Little Things"

**Instructor's Philosophy:**
> "These are the little things. These are the little things you're not going to learn in a regular training class, but these are the important things because they're the things that will endear you to your buyers and sellers because you're on top of everything."

## Security Deposit Transfer Requirements

### The Contract Provision (Line 186+)

**For Two-Family or Rental Properties:**

**Required Information:**
1. Tenant's name
2. Location (which unit)
3. Monthly rent amount
4. Security deposit amount
5. Term of lease

### The Critical Security Deposit Issue

**Legal Requirement:**
- Security deposits must be transferred at closing
- Must be handed over from seller to buyer

**The Problem:**
> "Lawyers forget about this."

**Why This Is CRITICAL:**

### The Legal Liability

**New Jersey Law:**
- Landlords must put security deposits in separate tenant security account at a bank
- **Many landlords don't do this**
- **Fine for non-compliance:** THREE TIMES the security deposit

### The Nightmare Scenario

**Timeline:**
1. You buy rental property
2. Closing happens - seller doesn't give you security deposit
3. Two years pass
4. Tenant moves out, wants security deposit back
5. **You have no security deposit**
6. **You can be liable for 3X the security deposit**

**Example Math:**
- Original security deposit: $2,000
- **Your liability:** $6,000 (3X penalty)
- You paid $4,000 extra because seller didn't transfer it

### Agent's Responsibility

**Remind Your Buyers:**
> "You want the security deposit. You want the security deposit. You want the security deposit."

**Why Emphasis:**
- Lawyers often forget
- Buyers don't know about 3X penalty
- Sellers may "forget" or claim they used it
- **This protects your buyer from massive liability**

### Best Practice

**At Closing:**
1. Verify security deposit amount(s)
2. Verify check or transfer is included in closing documents
3. Don't let closing complete without it
4. Get written confirmation of transfer

**If Seller Claims They Don't Have It:**
- Document this immediately
- Consider escrow arrangement
- Consult with attorney
- **Don't proceed without resolution** - buyer's risk is too high

## Lead Paint Certification for Rentals

### The New Requirement

**For All Two-Family Rental Properties:**

**Frequency:**
- Must be inspected every 2 years
- OR upon new tenant moving in

**Process:**
1. Landlord gets lead paint inspection
2. Receives lead safe certification
3. Must provide to new tenant
4. **Agent must get copy** for listing

### Two Types of Certifications

#### Option 1: Standard Certification
- **Cost:** Less expensive
- **Validity:** 2 years
- **Re-inspection:** Every 2 years OR new tenant (whichever comes first)

#### Option 2: Full Lead-Free Certification
- **Process:** Take plugs from walls to test for lead
- **Cost:** More expensive
- **Validity:** If no lead found → FOREVER
- **No re-inspection needed**

**Lead Inspector's Warning:**
> "Any house prior to [1978] has lead somewhere in those layers of paint. It could be 10 layers under, but it's there."

### Where Lead Problems Occur

**Primary Problem Areas:**
1. **Woodwork with cracks**
2. **Windows (opening and closing):**
   - New replacement windows: Usually no problem
   - Old windows: Shedding layers of paint when opened/closed
   - This is where most exposure happens

### Agent Responsibilities

**When Listing Two-Family:**
1. **Advise landlord** of lead paint certification requirement
2. **Get copy of certification** from landlord
3. **Upload certification** as a document in MLS listing
4. **Make available** to potential buyers

**The Reality:**
> "Most landlords have no knowledge of this. A lot of them don't."

**Your Job:**
- Educate them
- Make sure they comply
- Protect them from liability

### Liability for Non-Compliance

**Landlords can be SUED if:**
- They don't get certification
- They don't provide it to tenant
- Tenant or tenant's child has lead exposure

### Where to Find Information

**In the Contract:**
- Section on "Lead Safe Certifications"
- References guide from NJ Department of Community Affairs
- "Guide to Lead-Based Paint in Rental Dwellings"

---

## Inspection Contingency Timelines

### The Inspection Paragraph

**Key Timeline Information:**
- **Default:** 14 calendar days for buyer's right to inspection (if left blank)
- Contains multiple dates with defaults
- 3 business days for seller to respond

### Instructor's Approach

**On Dates:**
> "I leave them alone [defaults]. I always tighten that [timeline] have the inspection done right away."

**Recommendation:**
- Get inspection done as soon as attorney review is over
- Don't wait the full 14 days
- **Benefits buyer** by expediting process
- **Benefits seller** by knowing results sooner

### Why Tighten Inspection Timeline?

**Homeowner Happiness:**
- When you tighten all the dates in contract
- It doesn't extend the closing date
- Everything moves faster
- Sellers appreciate efficiency

**Many Agents' Mistake:**
- Use all default timelines
- Results in longer process
- Delays closing unnecessarily

**Flexibility:**
> "Many people do if the homeowner lets you [extend timelines]."

**But default should be fast, not slow.**

### Responsibility to Cure

**The Paragraph:**
- Contains days that "go back and forth"
- Seller has time to cure inspection issues
- Buyer has time to respond

**Instructor's Approach:**
> "I leave them alone."

**Defaults work fine for the back-and-forth negotiation process.**

## Flood Risk Assessment

### Flood Hazard vs. Flood Risk

**Two Different Designations:**
1. **Flood Hazard Area**
2. **Flood Risk Area**

**Important:** Research the difference between these

### Where to Find Flood Information

**Multiple Resources:**

#### 1. MLS Tools:
- Realist platform has flood information

#### 2. Title Company:
- Regency Title can provide flood designation

#### 3. Online Resources:
- Two websites listed in contract for flood risks
- Search by address

### The Mortgage Requirement

**If Property in Flood Zone:**
- Mortgage broker WILL require flood insurance
- Not "may require" - WILL require
- This is mandatory for lending

### The Miranda Strategy

**Real Research Method:**
> "Call the neighborhood. Ask: 'How bad was it? Did you really flood? Blah blah blah.'"

**Why This Works:**
- Official designations may not reflect reality
- Some "flood zones" never actually flood
- Neighbors know the real history
- Can give buyer confidence even in flood zone

**Example:**
- Property shows as flood risk
- Call neighbors: "Has this area ever flooded?"
- Neighbors: "Never in 40 years"
- **Result:** Buyer has real-world data, not just designation

---

## Inspector Qualifications

### Who Can Do Inspections

**The Paragraph Says:**
> "The qualification of the inspectors... it can't be your Uncle Harry."

**Requirements:**
- Must be a REAL qualified inspector
- Can't be just somebody pulled off the street
- Must have proper certifications
- Must be licensed/insured

**Why This Matters:**
- Inspection must be valid for contract
- Mortgage lender may require qualified inspector
- Protects buyer legally
- "Otherwise it doesn't work"

---

## Water Quality Testing

### Well Water Requirements

**If Property Has Well:**
- Homeowner's responsibility to have well water tested
- Required for closing if on well water
- Must meet health standards

**Testing Includes:**
- Bacteria
- Contaminants
- Potability standards

---

## Megan's Law Disclosure

### What is Megan's Law?

**Legal Restriction:**
> "You may not indicate to any buyer your knowledge of a pedophile."

**Instructor's Opinion:**
> "Which I think has its good and bad points."

### The Registry

**Contract Language:**
> "Buyer is notified that New Jersey establishes an Internet registry of sex offenders that may be accessed at www.njsp.org [New Jersey State Police]"

**Process:**
1. Contract points buyers to registry
2. Buyers can research themselves
3. Agent CANNOT volunteer this information
4. Agent CANNOT indicate knowledge of sex offenders in area

### The Uncertainty

**Problem with Registry:**
> "Whether it's accurate or not, we don't know because people move."

**Registry may not be current or complete**

---

## Notification of Off-Site Conditions

**The Paragraph:**
- Allows research of off-site conditions
- Landfills, industrial sites, noise sources
- Environmental concerns near property

**Agent Responsibility:**
- Can research these conditions
- Should disclose if known
- Buyer can investigate further

---

## Air Safety Notice

**The Paragraph:**
> "That's not important really. It's just where planes are going overhead."

**Relates to:**
- Proximity to airports
- Flight paths
- Noise considerations

**Generally not a major issue unless:**
- Very close to airport
- Direct flight path
- Buyer specifically concerned about noise

---

## Bulk Sales

**The Paragraph:**
> "That doesn't apply to us."

**What It's About:**
- Withholding tax for anybody leaving the country
- Commercial transactions
- Not relevant to residential real estate

---

## Insurance Requirements for All-Cash Buyers

### The Critical Oversight

**The Problem:**
> "You may have a lot of people who are buying all cash. It's happening a lot lately. I don't know where they're getting all the money from, but they are. And they forget to get insurance."

### Why Mortgage Buyers Don't Forget

**With Mortgage:**
- Bank DEMANDS insurance
- Lender won't close without it
- Built-in reminder system

**All-Cash Purchase:**
- Nobody requiring insurance
- No bank to demand it
- Easy to forget in moving chaos

### The Real-World Horror Story

**Instructor's Personal Experience:**
> "I do know somebody that happened to. Really."

**What Happened:**
1. Bought house in Florida
2. Had mortgage initially
3. **Paid off mortgage** - bank no longer reminds about insurance
4. "Now it's hard for me to get insurance because I went almost a year without it."

**The Consequences:**
- Had to pay for inspection
- Inspection found roof is old
- **Insurance cost:** Used to pay $1,500, now they want $5,000
- "I'm still without insurance because in Florida now it's hurricane season."
- **Current status:** "Can't even get insurance right now" → Has to self-insure

### Agent's Responsibility

**The Warning to Give:**
> "I know you're buying all-cash. There'll be nobody out there reminding you to insure the property."

**What You're Doing:**
- Providing service no one else will
- Protecting buyer from massive exposure
- Building trust through genuine care
- Preventing nightmare scenario

### The Self-Insurance Reality

**If You Go Without Insurance Long Enough:**
- May be forced to self-insure
- Much higher costs when you finally get coverage
- Inspection requirements increase
- Past issues (like old roof) now become problems
- Harder to get coverage after lapse

**Florida Specific Issues:**
- Hurricane season restrictions
- Higher costs in coastal areas
- Stricter inspection requirements
- Roof age becomes critical factor

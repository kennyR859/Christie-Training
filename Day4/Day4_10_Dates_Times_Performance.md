# Day 4 - Topic 10: Dates and Times of Performance

## Overview

Every date in a real estate contract is now "of the essence" - meaning it's a firm deadline that must be met or mutually extended. This relatively new contract language (only added a few years ago) has made deadline management critical to successful transactions. Missing a deadline can void the contract or create legal liability.

**Core Principle:** Every date is carved in stone. Set reminders for every deadline. Track everything systematically.

---

## "Time is of the Essence" - What This Means

### The Contract Language (Lines 1-5)

**Critical statement in every contract:**
> "Seller and Buyer agree that all dates and times included in this contract are of the essence."

### Historical Context: How This Changed

**Old Meaning (Years Ago):**

**The old system:**
1. Closing date was November 1st
2. Closing doesn't happen on November 1st
3. **THEN** lawyer adds "time is of the essence" AFTER the missed date
4. **Effect:** Gives 10 more days to close
5. Either close in 10 days OR get mutual extension
6. Used as remedy for missed deadlines

**The problem with old system:**
- Dates weren't treated as firm
- Extensions were assumed
- Deadlines were suggestions
- Created casual approach to timelines

### New Meaning (Current Contracts)

**The new reality:**
> "Time is of the essence is now IN the contract from Day 1"

**What this means:**
1. **Every date is carved in stone** from contract signing
2. **Every date is an important date** - no minor vs. major deadlines
3. **Must perform OR get mutual extension** - can't just miss deadlines
4. **No automatic grace periods** - must negotiate extensions

**When this was added:**
> "Wasn't in contracts before. Only been there a couple of years."

**Why it was added:**
- Make transactions more predictable
- Force parties to meet deadlines
- Reduce casual attitude toward dates
- Create consequences for delays

## Critical Dates Paragraph in Contract

### The New Addition

**Contract statement:**
> "Dates and times of performance are very specific. This contract is subject to seller agreeing that the dates and times included in this contract [are of the essence]."

**What this adds:**
- Makes timing even more critical
- Seller must agree to deadlines
- Creates mutual accountability
- Emphasizes importance of timeline

**Historical note:**
- Only been in contracts for a couple of years
- Relatively recent addition
- Shows trend toward stricter deadline enforcement

---

## Agent's Responsibility: Track EVERY Date

### Why This Matters

**Your job:**
- Track EVERY date in the contract
- Set reminders for every deadline
- Can't forget ANY deadline
- Proactive follow-up required

**The consequences of missing dates:**
- Contract could be voided
- Client loses house or buyer
- Legal liability for agent
- Professional reputation damage
- Possible E&O insurance claim

### Creating a Reminder System

**Example timeline tracking:**

**Closing date:** December 30th

**Agent reminder system:**
> "What you do is on the 30th of December, this closing is going to take place. So on the 25th of December... you make sure that your C.O. is done, that you're doing your walk-throughs, that everything is in order."

**Set reminders:**
- Around December 25th (or before Christmas in this example)
- Check:
  - Is C.O. done?
  - Walk-through scheduled?
  - Everything in order?
  - All documents ready?

**For every deadline in contract:**
1. Set reminder 3-5 days before
2. Check if task is complete
3. Follow up if not
4. Get extension if needed (before deadline!)
5. Check off when complete

## Default Timelines in Contract

### What Happens If Dates Left Blank

**Standard defaults:**
- **Attorney review:** 3 business days (mandatory in Northern NJ)
- **Inspection:** 14 calendar days (if blank)
- **Mortgage application:** 10 days
- **10% deposit:** 10 days after attorney review
- **Other provisions:** Have their own defaults (10 or 15 days usually)

### Instructor's Approach to Defaults

**General philosophy:**
> "I leave them alone [the defaults]. I do do it when I want to make the perfect contract."

**When to use defaults:**
- Standard transactions
- No special urgency
- Buyer and seller comfortable with standard timelines
- Normal market conditions

**When to tighten timelines:**
- Creating "perfect contract"
- Competitive situation
- Motivated seller wants fast close
- Cash buyer with no mortgage contingency

---

## Creating the "Perfect Contract" Timeline

### The Strategy

**Instructor's approach:**
- Tighten ALL timeline dates
- Move everything to "immediately"
- Create fastest possible path to closing
- Show seller you're serious and organized

### Sample Perfect Contract Timeline

**Start Date:** Today (Wednesday, example: November 4th)

#### Attorney Review Period

**Standard language:** 3 business days

**Timeline:**
- Contract signed: Wednesday
- Can't count weekend
- **Attorney review ends:** Monday (November 11th)

**What happens during this time:**
- Lawyers review contract
- Either party can cancel for any reason
- Lawyers negotiate changes
- Must be done in 3 business days

#### 10% Deposit

**Default timing:** 10 days after attorney review

**Instructor's "perfect contract" preference:**
> "Bring 10% immediately after attorney review OR day contract goes under contract. Don't wait the default 10 days."

**Perfect contract date:** November 11th or 12th

**Why move it up:**
- Shows buyer commitment
- Seller has security sooner
- Eliminates one waiting period
- Creates momentum

**Important flexibility note:**
> "It could be 5%, it could be 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%. It could actually be the whole price put into escrow."

#### The $200K Unit Example

**Sample scenario:**
- Purchase price: $200,000
- Getting mortgage: $100,000
- Cash from buyer: $100,000

**Standard approach:**
- $20,000 down as 10% deposit
- Balance ($80,000) at closing

**"Perfect Contract" option:**
- Put entire $100,000 in escrow immediately
- Why this makes perfect contract:
  - No worries about proof of funds
  - Shows ultimate commitment
  - Eliminates financing concerns for cash portion
  - Seller has maximum security

#### Mortgage Application Timeline

**Default:** 10 days to apply for mortgage

**Instructor's preference:**
> "In additional contractual provisions... person will apply for their mortgage immediately."

**"Immediately" means:**
- Apply for mortgage right away
- Don't wait the 10 days
- Start process same day as attorney review ends
- Get commitment letter ASAP

**Why this matters:**
- Identifies problems early
- Gets underwriting started
- Shows buyer seriousness
- Protects both parties

#### Home Inspection Timeline

**Default:** 14 days (if left blank)

**Instructor's preference:**
> "Home inspections immediately. Apply for it immediately."

**"Immediately" means:**
- Schedule inspection right away
- Don't wait the full 14 days
- Get it done in first week if possible
- Know results early

**Benefits:**
1. **Identifies problems early** - time to negotiate or walk away
2. **Keeps momentum** - transaction moves fast
3. **Protects seller** - knows if deal will survive inspection quickly
4. **Protects buyer** - plenty of time to review and decide

#### Title Work Timeline

**Company preference:** Use Regency Title

**Timing:**
> "Apply for it immediately."

**Why Regency Title:**
- Even if deal falls through (no mortgage, failed inspection) → Won't charge
- Apply immediately so you can have 3-way closing
- Fast turnaround

**3-way closing benefit:**
- Seller's payoff handled at closing
- Buyer's new loan funded
- All happens simultaneously
- Clean, efficient closing

### Complete Mortgage and Closing Timeline

**Standard mortgage timeline:** 30 days

**Instructor's complete timeline:**

**Mortgage approval:** 30 days from contract date
- Application submitted immediately
- Underwriting process
- Appraisal ordered and completed
- Final approval at 30 days

**Lender review period:** 3 days before closing
- **Required by law** for borrower to review closing documents
- Lender must provide docs 3 days before
- Borrower reviews terms
- Can't close without this period

**Closing date:** 35 days from contract date

**The math:**
> "Bank needs to review the paperwork for 3 days prior to closing, so closing date would be maybe 35 days."

**Why 35 days, not 30:**
- 30 days for mortgage approval
- PLUS 3 days mandatory lender review
- PLUS 2 days buffer = 35 days total

**Important notes:**
- Pre-approval letters sometimes include closing date
- Usually agent sets timeline from contract date
- Use from date it goes under contract
- Count from contract acceptance, not offer submission

## Managing Extensions and Delays

### When You Need an Extension

**Reasons extensions are needed:**
- Mortgage approval delayed
- Inspection reveals major issues needing negotiation
- Appraisal comes in low, renegotiation needed
- C.O. inspection delayed by town
- Weather delays construction repairs
- Attorney scheduling conflicts

### How to Request Extension

**Timing is critical:**
> Request extension BEFORE deadline passes, not after

**Professional request format:**

**To other agent:**
> "The inspection revealed some issues that require additional evaluation. We need to extend the inspection deadline by 5 days to [new date]. Can you get seller's approval for this extension?"

**In writing:**
- Email or formal extension agreement
- State old deadline and new deadline
- Get written agreement from all parties
- Add to contract file

**Mutual agreement required:**
- Both parties must agree
- Can't unilaterally extend
- Must be in writing
- Becomes part of contract

## Special Timing Considerations

### Business Days vs. Calendar Days

**Attorney review:** 3 BUSINESS days
- Don't count weekends
- Don't count holidays
- Count actual business days

**Most other deadlines:** Calendar days
- Count every day including weekends
- Count holidays
- Continuous count from start date

**Always check contract language:**
- Does it say "business days" or "days"?
- When in doubt, assume calendar days
- Attorney can clarify

### Holiday Considerations

**Christmas example from lecture:**
- Closing on December 30th
- Reminder set around December 25th
- Account for holiday schedules:
  - Town offices may be closed
  - Inspectors may be unavailable
  - Attorneys may be on vacation
  - Banks may have limited hours

**Best practice:**
- Plan around major holidays
- Build in extra buffer time
- Confirm availability of all parties
- Don't schedule critical deadlines during holiday weeks

## Best Practices for Timeline Management

### At Contract Signing

### Weekly Check-ins

**Every Monday (or consistent day):**
1. Review upcoming week's deadlines
2. Confirm what needs to happen
3. Follow up on previous week's items
4. Alert client to upcoming tasks

**Communication format:**
> "This week we have [X deadline] on [date]. You need to [specific action]. I'll follow up on [day] to confirm completion."

### The Week Before Closing

**Final checklist review:**
- [ ] C.O. obtained and in file

## Summary

**The Timeline Management Formula:**

```
Input All Contract Dates Immediately
    ↓
Set Reminders 3-5 Days Before Each Deadline
    ↓
Share Timeline with Clients
    ↓
Track Completion and Request Extensions Early If Needed
    ↓
= Smooth Transaction + No Missed Deadlines + Protected Clients
```

**The Five Critical Rules:**
1. **Every date is "of the essence"** - firm deadlines, not suggestions
2. **Set reminders for EVERYTHING** - don't rely on memory
3. **Tighten timelines when possible** - creates momentum and shows commitment
4. **Request extensions BEFORE deadlines** - never after
5. **Communicate deadlines to clients** - they need to know what to do when

**Remember:** The addition of "time is of the essence" language to contracts has fundamentally changed deadline management. What used to be flexible is now firm. Missing a deadline can void a contract or create liability.

**The Ultimate Goal:** Create a systematic timeline tracking process that ensures no deadline is ever missed, extensions are requested proactively when needed, and clients always know what's expected and when.

# Day 4 - Topic 02: Weather-Based Prospecting Strategy

## Overview

Bad weather creates one of the best prospecting opportunities in real estate. When it's snowing, raining, or freezing cold, people are home, captive to their thoughts, and often thinking about how much they hate their current situation. This is your moment to call and catch them when they're most motivated.

**Core Strategy:** Make prospecting calls during bad weather when people are home and emotionally ready to make a change.

## The Psychology of Bad Weather Prospecting

### Why Bad Weather Works

**What happens during storms:**
1. **People stay home** - captive audience
2. **They think about discomfort** - "I'm sick of this weather"
3. **They have time** - not rushing anywhere
4. **They're emotional** - ready to make decisions
5. **They answer phones** - nothing else to do

**The emotional trigger:**
> "We're so sick of this white [snow]. We want to get out of here!"

### The Perfect Storm (Literally)

**Best prospecting weather:**
- Heavy snow
- Ice storms
- Freezing rain
- Extreme cold
- Heat waves (in summer)

**Why these work best:**
- Maximum discomfort
- Can't leave house
- Thinking about how much they hate it
- Ready to talk about moving

## The Success Story: Circle Prospecting in Snow

### The Setup

**Instructor's experience:**
- Making prospecting calls
- Bad weather day
- Calling neighborhood listings

### The Call That Changed Everything

**What happened:**

> "This woman answers the phone and I said, 'I'm looking for a listing. I was calling to see if anybody knew of anybody in the neighborhood who might be thinking of selling.'"

**Her response:**
> "I can't believe this! My husband and I are sitting here having our breakfast coffee. We are so sick of this white [snow]. We want to get out of here!"

**Agent's question:**
> "Where are you going?"

**Her answer:**
> "Florida."

**Agent's response:**
> "OK, I have a friend in Florida. Let me have her send you some listings."

### The Outcome

**Results from ONE phone call:**
1. **Listed her house** - got the listing on the spot
2. **Got referral fee** - from Florida agent friend
3. **All because of bad weather timing** - caught her at peak frustration

**Instructor's reflection:**
> "She was a character, a very funny lady. I loved them. They were ready to go somewhere warm."

### Why This Call Worked

**Perfect timing elements:**
1. **Bad weather** - maximum frustration
2. **Breakfast time** - relaxed, together, talking
3. **Right question** - "anybody in neighborhood thinking of selling"
4. **Solution-focused** - immediately offered help with Florida listings
5. **Personal connection** - "I loved them" - genuine relationship

## Advanced Weather Strategy: The Elderly Homeowner Opportunity

### The Creative Approach

**Agent from class suggested:**
> "I think I would go as far as identifying communities I want to work in and identifying those houses that have that little old lady that's by herself, husband passed, and go help her with the snow."

**Instructor's response:**
> "That's great! That's why you're good, that's why you own your own business - because you're creative and you think out of the box."

### Why This Strategy is Brilliant

**The benefits:**
1. **Genuine help** - actually solving a problem
2. **Memorable service** - "She's going to remember me forever"
3. **Builds trust** - actions speak louder than words
4. **Natural conversation** - leads to relationship
5. **Future listing** - when she's ready to sell, you're the obvious choice

### How to Find These Opportunities

**The old way:**
- Walk around looking for elderly homeowners
- Time-consuming
- Hit or miss

**The new way (using Remine - covered tomorrow):**
> "We're going to know how to do it tomorrow. By going into Remine you can filter anybody that's been in their home for 25 years, 30 years, 15 years, anybody whose mortgage is paid off."

**What Remine can find:**
- Long-term homeowners (25-30+ years)
- Paid-off mortgages
- High "sell score" (analytics predict readiness)
- Online behavior (looking at Florida, retirement communities)

## The Balance: Calls vs. Shoveling

### The Instructor's Guidance

**On the creative snow-shoveling strategy:**
> "This is all about thinking out of the box."

**BUT - the important caveat:**
> "But the calls are still more important."

### Why Calls Come First

**The math:**
- **Shoveling:** Help 5-10 people per day maximum
- **Calling:** Contact 50-100 people per day
- **Shoveling:** Maybe 1-2 future listings
- **Calling:** Immediate listings possible

**The priority:**
1. **Make the calls** during bad weather
2. **Then** do physical prospecting (shoveling)
3. **Or** target specific elderly homeowners identified through Remine

### The Integrated Strategy

**Best approach:**
1. **Morning:** Make calls (people home, emotional about weather)
2. **Afternoon:** Help elderly neighbors you identified
3. **Evening:** Follow up calls to morning contacts
4. **Result:** Maximum prospecting impact

## Timing Your Weather Prospecting

### Best Times to Call During Bad Weather

**Morning (7-10 AM):**
- People having coffee
- Looking out at the weather
- Discussing with spouse
- Emotional peak about conditions

**Midday (12-2 PM):**
- Lunch at home (can't go out)
- Cabin fever setting in
- Ready for distraction

**Evening (5-7 PM):**
- Home from work (if they went)
- Dinner time conversations
- Thinking about the commute
- Tired of the weather

### Worst Times (Even in Bad Weather)

**Too early (before 7 AM):**
- People still sleeping
- Annoying to call

**Dinner time (exact meal time varies):**
- Interrupting family time
- Will be short/annoyed

**Too late (after 8 PM):**
- Winding down
- Don't want to be disturbed

## Scripts for Weather-Based Prospecting

### The "Checking In" Script

**Opening:**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company]. How are you holding up in this weather?"

**Connection:**
> "I know this weather has been brutal. I was actually thinking about homeowners in your neighborhood and wanted to reach out."

**The Ask:**
> "Do you know of anyone in the neighborhood who might be thinking about selling? Sometimes this weather makes people think about moving somewhere warmer."

**If they mention themselves:**
> "Oh really? Where are you thinking of going?"

### The "Direct Approach" Script

**Opening:**
> "Hi, this is [Your Name], a real estate agent working in your area."

**The Hook:**
> "I was calling because days like this, when we're all stuck inside, tend to be when people start thinking about making a change."

**The Question:**
> "Have you ever thought about selling, or do you know anyone in the neighborhood who has?"

### The "Value-Add" Script

**Opening:**
> "Hi [Name], [Your Name] here from [Company]. Hope you're staying warm!"

**The Offer:**
> "I'm calling neighbors today to let them know I have a friend/client looking to buy in this area. Do you know anyone thinking of selling?"

**Plant the seed:**
> "And if you ever think about it yourself, I'd love to help. Especially if you're thinking somewhere warmer after a winter like this!"

## Weather-Based Marketing (Beyond Calls)

### Social Media Posts During Bad Weather

**Example posts:**

**During snow storm:**
> "Stuck inside watching the snow? Many of my clients decided to sell and move to warmer climates after winters just like this one. If you've been thinking about it, let's talk when the snow melts! 🌴"

**During heat wave:**
> "105 degrees today? Some of my clients have moved to milder climates. If the heat is getting to you, let's discuss your options when it cools down!"

### Email Campaigns

**Subject line:**
> "Sick of this weather? You're not alone."

**Body:**
> "I've helped 15 families move to their dream locations after brutal winters like this one. If you've been thinking about a change, reply to this email - I'd love to help you plan your next chapter."

### Direct Mail

**Postcard during winter:**
- **Front:** Picture of beach/palm trees
- **Back:** "Ready for a change? Call me to discuss selling."

## Combining Weather Prospecting with Other Strategies

### Weather + Circle Prospecting

**After a listing:**
1. Put up your sign
2. Wait for next bad weather
3. Call the circle: "Hi, I just listed [address]. Do you know anyone thinking of selling?"
4. **Weather hook:** "Especially with this weather, I have clients looking to move."

### Weather + Sphere of Influence

**Text your SOI during bad weather:**
> "Hope you're staying warm! If this weather has you thinking about moving somewhere sunnier, I'd love to help. Know anyone who's had enough?"

### Weather + Farming

**Your farm list during bad weather:**
1. Call your farm area
2. Reference the weather
3. Ask about selling/moving
4. Follow up with mail piece after weather clears

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Only Calling in Good Weather
- **Problem:** People are out, busy, not thinking about leaving
- **Solution:** Prioritize calling during bad weather

### Mistake 2: Complaining About the Weather
- **Problem:** Makes you seem negative
- **Solution:** Acknowledge weather, pivot to solution (moving)

### Mistake 3: Not Having Next Location Ideas Ready
- **Problem:** They say "want to leave" but you have no suggestions
- **Solution:** Know popular destinations (Florida, Carolinas, etc.)

### Mistake 4: Shoveling Instead of Calling
- **Problem:** Help 5 people vs. reaching 50+
- **Solution:** Calls first, physical help second

### Mistake 5: Waiting for Perfect Weather to Prospect
- **Problem:** No urgency, no emotional trigger
- **Solution:** Bad weather IS perfect prospecting weather

## Measuring Success

### Track These Metrics

**Per weather event:**
- Calls made
- Conversations had
- Appointments set
- Listings obtained
- Referrals received

**Goal setting:**
- Minimum 50 calls per major weather event
- Target: 5-10 meaningful conversations
- Goal: 1-2 appointments per storm

### ROI of Weather Prospecting

**Time investment:**
- 3-4 hours of calling during storm
- Follow up: 1-2 hours next day

**Potential return:**
- 1 listing = worth the entire day
- Future relationships = long-term value
- Referrals to warm-climate agents = bonus income

## Summary

**The Weather Prospecting Formula:**

```
Bad Weather + Captive Audience + Emotional Discomfort
    ↓
Peak Motivation to Discuss Change
    ↓
Your Timely Call + Solution Focus
    ↓
= Listings + Relationships + Referrals
```

**Remember:** When everyone else is staying warm and not working, YOU are making calls and getting listings. This is how you differentiate yourself from the competition.

**The instructor's success story proves it:** ONE phone call during bad weather led to a listing AND a referral fee. That's the power of weather-based prospecting.

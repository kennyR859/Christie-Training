# Day 4 - Topic 12: Certificate of Occupancy Requirements

## Overview

A Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.) is a municipal certification that a property meets local building codes and is safe for occupancy. Not all New Jersey towns require it, but where it is required, failure to obtain it can delay or prevent closing. Agents must know which towns require it and ensure it's completed on time.

**Core Principle:** Always ask about C.O. status, even if it's "supposed to be" someone else's job. You're the one who will save the closing.

## What is a Certificate of Occupancy?

### The Official Definition

**Certificate of Occupancy:**
- Municipal certification that house meets code
- Issued after inspection by town building department
- Certifies property is safe for occupancy
- Required in many (but not all) New Jersey towns
- Must be obtained before closing in towns that require it

### What the Inspection Covers

**Typical C.O. inspection includes:**
- **Building structure** - no unsafe conditions
- **Electrical systems** - up to code, safe
- **Plumbing systems** - functional, no leaks
- **Heating systems** - working, safe
- **Smoke detectors** - present and functional
- **Carbon monoxide detectors** - present and functional
- **Handrails and guardrails** - safe and secure
- **Egress windows** - bedrooms have proper escape routes
- **Stair dimensions** - risers and treads meet code
- **General safety** - no hazardous conditions

**What inspectors look for:**
- Code violations
- Safety hazards
- Illegal additions or alterations
- Unpermitted work
- Structural issues

## Which Towns Require C.O.?

### Towns WITHOUT C.O. Requirement

**Surprising example - Ridgewood:**
> "Ridgewood (surprisingly) - BUT has fire certification instead"

**What this means:**
- Some towns don't require full C.O.
- But may require fire inspection
- Or other certifications
- Always check specific town requirements

### Towns WITH Strict C.O. Requirements

**Fairlawn - The Nightmare:**
> "Rigid, rigid one. That inspector, she is a nightmare."

**Why Fairlawn is particularly difficult:**
- Inspector goes through everything
- Measures height of steps going in and out of house
- Very strict code enforcement
- "Really tough"
- Takes longer to get approval
- May require multiple re-inspections

**What "rigid" inspection means:**
- Every detail checked
- No lenient interpretations
- Must meet exact code requirements
- Small violations flagged
- Multiple visits often needed

### Other Requirements

**Some towns require:**
- C.O.
- Fire certification
- Both C.O. AND fire certification
- Other safety certifications

**You must know your market:**
- Which towns require what
- How long inspections take
- How strict inspectors are
- What common violations occur

## Agent Responsibilities by Role

### As Listing Agent: Your Duties

**1. Notify seller of requirement:**
- Tell them they need C.O. or fire certification (or both)
- Explain what it involves
- Provide timeline expectations
- Warn about potential issues

**2. Tell them to call the town:**
> "Tell them to call the town: Set up inspection appointment"

**What seller needs to do:**
- Call building department
- Request C.O. inspection
- Schedule appointment
- Pay inspection fee
- Prepare house for inspection

**3. Make sure they do it:**
> "Make sure they do it: Follow up that appointment is scheduled"

**Follow-up process:**
- Don't just tell them once
- Confirm they called
- Confirm appointment is scheduled
- Get appointment date
- Set reminder to follow up on results

**Why this matters:**
- Sellers procrastinate
- They don't understand urgency
- They think they have time
- Then it becomes crisis at closing

### As Buyer's Agent: Your Verification Duties

**1. Make sure seller DID get C.O.:**
- Ask listing agent for status
- Confirm inspection happened
- Confirm any violations addressed
- Verify C.O. issued

**2. Ask where C.O. is during walk-through:**
> "Ask where C.O. is"

**Walk-through verification:**
- Physically see the C.O.
- Check that it's properly issued
- Verify address matches
- Confirm it's recent/current

**3. Verify C.O. is available before closing:**
- Will be presented at closing
- Attorney has copy
- Title company has copy
- Ready for recording

## The Horror Story: What Happens When Nobody Asks

### Instructor's Personal Experience

**The situation:**
> "I've been on a walk-through when the seller's agent nor did the seller ever get a C.O."

**What happened:**
1. Walk-through day arrives
2. Buyer's agent (instructor) asks: "Where is the C.O.?"
3. **Shock:** Nobody got it
4. Not seller
5. Not seller's agent
6. Nobody even thought about it

**The crisis:**
> "We had to rush and get it so we could meet the closing date."

**The scramble:**
- Emergency call to town
- Rush inspection request
- Hope inspector available
- Pray no violations found
- Stress on everyone
- Closing date at risk

**Who saved the closing:**
> "Thank God I asked where was the C.O."

**Without that question:**
- Closing would have been cancelled
- Both parties inconvenienced
- Moving trucks turned away
- Contracts renegotiated
- Agents look incompetent

---

## The New Practice: Always Ask

### Making It Standard Operating Procedure

**Instructor's change in practice:**
> "Now I make it a practice... after that happened to me, I make it a practice to require... [asking about C.O.]"

**What "make it a practice" means:**
- Add to every transaction checklist
- Ask on every walk-through
- Verify in every closing preparation
- Never assume it's done

### Who SHOULD Be Asking (But Often Doesn't)

**People who should verify C.O. but don't always:**

**1. Attorney for buyer:**
- Should ask for C.O.
- Should verify before closing
- **But often doesn't**

**2. Listing agent:**
- Should ensure seller gets it
- Should follow up
- **But often doesn't**

**3. Title company:**
- Should request it
- Should verify before closing
- Sometimes does, sometimes doesn't

**The reality:**
> "But often NO ONE asks"

**Why agents MUST ask:**
- Can't rely on others
- You're the one at closing
- You're the one client blames
- **You can save or kill the deal**

## Critical Timeline and Requirements

### When to Start C.O. Process

**Immediate action after listing:**
- Week 1: Seller notified
- Week 2: Confirm seller called town
- Week 3: Inspection scheduled
- Week 4: Inspection happens
- Week 5: Violations addressed (if any)
- Week 6: Re-inspection (if needed)
- Week 7: C.O. issued

**For typical transaction (30-45 days):**
- Start C.O. process immediately at listing
- Don't wait until contract
- Can take 4-8 weeks in some towns
- Rigid inspectors require more time

### Who Wants to See C.O. at Closing

**Both title company AND attorney:**
> "Both title company AND attorney want to see C.O."

**Why they require it:**

**Title company:**
- Ensures property is legally occupiable
- No municipal violations on record
- Clean title transfer
- Protects their title insurance

**Attorney:**
- Ensures closing is legal
- Property can be transferred
- Buyer can legally occupy
- Protects client interests

**Lender (if mortgage):**
- May require C.O. for funding
- Ensures property meets standards
- Protects collateral
- May be in loan requirements

**The absolute rule:**
> "You won't close without it"

**No exceptions:**
- Can't promise to get it later
- Can't escrow for it (in most cases)
- Must have it in hand
- **Closing will not happen**

## Fire Certification vs. Certificate of Occupancy

### Towns with Fire Certification Instead

**Example: Ridgewood**
- Doesn't require full C.O.
- **But requires fire certification**
- Fire department inspection
- Focuses on fire safety

### What Fire Certification Covers

**Typical fire inspection:**
- Smoke detector placement and function
- Carbon monoxide detector compliance
- Fire exits and egress
- Fire hazards
- Fire extinguisher (in some towns)
- Heating system safety

### Some Towns Require BOTH

**Double requirement:**
- Full C.O. from building department
- Fire certification from fire department
- Two separate inspections
- Two separate fees
- Both must be completed

**Agent must know:**
- Which towns require which certifications
- Timeline for each
- Fees for each
- Process for each

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Assuming Someone Else Will Handle It
- **Problem:** Nobody handles it, closing cancelled
- **Solution:** You verify it personally, every time

### Mistake 2: Not Starting Early Enough
- **Problem:** Run out of time, especially in strict towns
- **Solution:** Start C.O. process immediately at listing

### Mistake 3: Not Following Up with Seller
- **Problem:** Seller doesn't call, doesn't schedule, forgets
- **Solution:** Weekly follow-up until C.O. issued

### Mistake 4: Not Asking to See It During Walk-Through
- **Problem:** Discover it's missing on closing day
- **Solution:** Always ask to see original during walk-through

### Mistake 5: Assuming All Towns Have Same Requirements
- **Problem:** Miss fire certification or other requirements
- **Solution:** Research each town's specific requirements

## Action Items

- [ ] Create list of all towns in your market with C.O. requirements
- [ ] Research each town's C.O. process and timeline
- [ ] Get contact info for building departments in your area
- [ ] Add C.O. notification to listing presentation checklist
- [ ] Add C.O. verification to walk-through checklist
- [ ] Create C.O. follow-up reminder system
- [ ] Practice asking: "Where is the C.O.?"
- [ ] Add C.O. status to weekly transaction review
- [ ] Create town-specific C.O. reference sheet

## Summary

**The C.O. Management Formula:**

```
Notify Seller Immediately (Listing Agent)
    ↓
Follow Up Weekly Until Completed
    ↓
Verify C.O. Issued (Buyer's Agent)
    ↓
See Original at Walk-Through (Both Agents)
    ↓
= Closing Happens on Schedule
```

**The Four Critical Rules:**
1. **Know which towns require C.O.** - research your market
2. **Start process immediately** - don't wait, especially in strict towns
3. **Follow up relentlessly** - sellers will forget
4. **Always ask to see it** - even if it's "supposed to be" handled

**Remember:** Attorney, title company, and lender may all want to see C.O., but often nobody asks until closing day. You asking during walk-through can save the entire closing.

**The Ultimate Goal:** Ensure C.O. (and fire certification if required) is obtained on time, verified before closing, and available for presentation at closing table.

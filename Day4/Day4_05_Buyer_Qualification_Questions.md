# Day 4 - Topic 05: Buyer Qualification Questions

## Overview

Proper buyer qualification is the foundation of successful transactions. The right questions, asked at the right time, reveal everything you need to know: price range, decision-makers, motivation, timeline, and potential obstacles. This topic focuses specifically on Questions #7-9 from the buyer consultation process.

**Core Principle:** Permission-based selling through strategic questions, not statements.

## Question #7: The Business Value Proposition

### The Full Question

**Script:**
> "If you owned a business, would it be a good idea for me to establish what the value of your home is before we move forward?"

### What This Question Actually Does

**On the surface:**
- Asking if they want a home valuation
- Seems like helping them understand their current home value

**What it really does:**
1. **Opens listing conversation** without being pushy
2. **Not directly taking the listing** - just "establishing value"
3. **Business analogy** makes it professional and logical
4. **Positions you as advisor** helping them make informed decisions

### Why the Business Analogy Works

**Psychological framing:**
- "If you owned a business..." = frames them as smart decision-makers
- Business owners understand valuation before major moves
- Makes the request seem logical and businesslike
- Removes emotional resistance to "listing talk"

### When to Use This Question

**Perfect timing:**
- Early in buyer consultation
- When you suspect they need to sell first
- Before wasting time showing homes they can't afford
- Building relationship and trust

**Red flags that trigger this question:**
- "We need to sell our house first"
- "We're looking but not in a hurry"
- "We want to see what's out there"
- Any mention of selling current home

### What Happens After They Say Yes

**Your next steps:**
1. Schedule separate listing consultation
2. Prepare CMA (Comparative Market Analysis)
3. Visit their current property
4. Present valuation and pricing strategy
5. **Potentially get a listing before ever showing them properties**

### The Strategic Benefit

**Why this is brilliant:**
- You're not just a buyer's agent
- You're potentially a listing agent too
- Double-ended transaction possible
- Or two separate commissions (listing now, buying later)
- Builds stronger relationship

## Question #7 Alternative: The Indirect Price Discovery

### The Price Range Question

**Full Script:**
> "The home you called on is listed in the $900s. Is that the price range you're interested in?"

### Why This Works Better Than "What's Your Budget?"

**Direct question (WRONG):**
> "What's your budget?" or "How much can you spend?"

**Problems with direct approach:**
- Feels invasive
- Buyers get defensive
- They may lie (say lower than reality)
- Damages rapport

**Indirect approach (RIGHT):**
> "The home you called on is in the $900s. Is that the price range you're interested in?"

**Why this works:**
1. **Uses their own behavior** - they called on THIS listing
2. **Non-threatening** - just clarifying
3. **Natural conversation** - logical follow-up
4. **Reveals true range** through their response

### The Three Possible Responses

**Response A: "That's a little high for us"**
- **Translation:** Their actual budget is LOWER
- **Your action:** "OK, what range were you thinking?"
- **Result:** They tell you their real budget

**Response B: "No, we can really go a little higher"**
- **Translation:** Their actual budget is HIGHER
- **Your action:** "Great! What's your upper limit?"
- **Result:** You can show them better properties

**Response C: "Yes, that's our range"**
- **Translation:** They're being honest
- **Your action:** "Perfect! Let me find more in that range."
- **Result:** You have accurate search parameters

## The $400K vs $900K Disaster Story

### What Happened

**The Setup:**
- New agent gets call on $400,000 listing
- Agent is thorough and professional
- Sees EVERY $400,000 home in the area
- Prepares extensively
- Arrives ready to show $400K properties

**The Shock:**
- Buyers arrive
- Wife wearing gorgeous mink coat
- Driving Mercedes
- Husband has newspaper with circled properties
- **All circled properties are in the $900s**

**Agent's Reaction:**
> "She almost collapsed."

### The Recovery

**Instructor was there:**
- Helped agent recover
- Asked buyers: "Why did you call on a $400,000 home when you can spend this much?"

**Buyer's Response:**
> "Well, I was just wondering what you could get for $400,000. Just out of curiosity."

**The Lesson:**
> "She was not prepared for that, and so she did take him out, she did show him, and we recovered. But if she had asked that question [about price range], and I was there, so I said, 'You know, just out of curiosity, why did you call on a $400,000 when you can spend this?'"

### Why This Happens

**Buyers' perspective:**
- Curious about value at different price points
- Testing the agent
- Not intentionally misleading
- Just casual inquiry that became showing

**Agent's mistake:**
- Assumed inquiry listing = actual budget
- Didn't ask the qualifying question
- Prepared for wrong price range
- **Wasted time and looked unprepared**

### How the Question Prevents This

**If agent had asked:**
> "The home you called on is $400,000. Is that your price range?"

**Buyer would have said:**
> "Oh no, we were just curious. We're actually looking in the $900s."

**Result:**
- Agent prepares for right range
- Shows appropriate properties
- Looks professional and prepared
- **No embarrassment, no wasted time**

## Question #8: Discovering Other Properties of Interest

### The Full Question

**Script:**
> "Were there any other homes or ads that interested you?"

### Why This Question is Critical

**What it uncovers:**
1. They may not know you can show EVERY listing
2. They've been looking at other properties
3. Reveals their actual preferences
4. Shows their activity level
5. Identifies competition (other agents they've contacted)

### The Education Moment

**Many buyers don't know:**
> "Everybody knows that you can show every home in New Jersey. And why don't they know that? 'Cause we don't tell them."

**Regional confusion:**
- **New York:** Fragmented MLS, brokers have exclusives
- **New Jersey:** Unified MLS, every agent can show everything
- Buyers moving from NY think they need multiple agents

**Your job:**
- Educate them about NJ MLS system
- Explain you can show ANY property
- Build trust and exclusivity

## The New York vs New Jersey MLS Story

### How New York Works (Or Doesn't)

**The Problem:**
> "Where they came from might have been New York where they don't have a centralized MLS. Well, they have one, it just doesn't work."

**New York reality:**
- Hell's Kitchen listings = specific brokers
- Upper East Side listings = different brokers
- Village, Soho, Noho = all separate
- **Buyers must go to multiple brokers** to see all inventory

**Result:**
- Buyers think this is normal everywhere
- Don't realize NJ is different
- Try to work with multiple agents

### How New Jersey Works

**The System:**
> "We have what? What kind of multiple do we have? It's a forced multiple."

**What "forced multiple" means:**
1. **EVERY listing must be shared** - no exceptions
2. **24-hour rule** - all listings in MLS within 24 hours
3. **Office exclusives** - still must be in MLS
4. **Sharing required** - cooperating or not, it's in MLS
5. **One agent can show everything** - statewide access

**MLS systems in NJ:**
- New Jersey MLS (Garden State MLS)
- Bergen MLS
- Hudson County MLS
- All share data through forced cooperation

### The 24-Hour Rule Explained

**What must be reported within 24 hours:**
1. **New listings** - including office exclusives
2. **Attorney review status** - immediately when in review
3. **Under contract** - immediately when signed
4. **Closing date** - when set
5. **Closing date changes** - if delayed beyond a couple days

**Why this matters:**
- Fair and equitable treatment of all agents
- Can't hide listings to keep showing coming
- Can't withhold information from buyers
- **Huge fines for non-compliance**

### The Attorney Review Reporting Problem

**What some brokers do (WRONG):**
- Don't report attorney review immediately
- Keep showing the property
- Collect more offers
- **Say "can't be shown" when you call**

**Why this is wrong:**
1. Unfair to other agents
2. Unfair to buyers
3. **Makes YOU look foolish** to your buyer
4. **You didn't know because they didn't report it**
5. Violation of MLS rules

**Instructor's frustration:**
> "You're trying to show it to a customer and they say 'can't be shown.' And why can't it be shown? Because it's in attorney review and they don't want to show it anymore. And that makes you look foolish because this buyer is saying, 'How come you didn't know that?'"

### Your Response to the Buyer

**When buyer asks "Were there other homes or ads that interested you?"**

**Your education message:**
> "Great question! In New Jersey, I can show you EVERY property that's for sale. We have a unified MLS system where all listings must be shared within 24 hours. Unlike New York where you might need multiple brokers, here you just need me. I have access to everything, and I can show you any property you're interested in."

**This accomplishes:**
1. Positions you as knowledgeable
2. Builds trust and loyalty
3. Prevents them from calling other agents
4. Explains your value
5. Sets expectation for exclusive relationship

## Question #9: Most Important Features

### The Full Question

**Script:**
> "What are the most important features you're looking for?"

### Why This Gets Very Specific

**Not just basics:**
- Not just "3 bedrooms, 2 baths"
- Not just "good neighborhood"
- **Get to the REAL needs**

**Examples of specific needs:**
> "This can be really really specific. I need a huge backyard because my kids play soccer or football or baseball. I need a huge backyard because my kids like to play outside."

**Other specific examples:**
- Home office for remote work
- First-floor master (elderly parents)
- Garage/workshop space for hobbies
- Specific school district for special needs child
- Flat yard for accessibility
- Pool for therapy/exercise
- Specific distance to train station

### The Dream vs Reality

**What buyers do:**
> "Sometimes people give you their dream, their dream home, all the things they want."

**The reality:**
> "But not all of them. No house is going to have them all."

**Your job:**
1. Listen to entire wish list
2. Identify top 3-5 MUST-HAVES
3. Separate needs from wants
4. Set realistic expectations
5. Prioritize search accordingly

### Using This to Filter Properties

**The process:**
1. **Get the list** - let them tell you everything
2. **Prioritize** - "Which of these are absolute must-haves?"
3. **Filter search** - focus on properties with top priorities
4. **Manage expectations** - "We may not find all 15 features, but we'll find your top 5"
5. **Adjust as needed** - priorities may change as they see properties

**Example filtering:**
- They want 10 features
- Only 2-3 are absolute must-haves
- Search based on those 2-3
- Others are bonuses
- **Don't waste time** on properties missing critical features

- **Problem:** Waste MORE time later with wrong properties
- **Solution:** Invest 30 minutes now, save hours later

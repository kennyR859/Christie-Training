# Day 4 - Topic 13: Utility Transfer Management

## Overview

Utility transfer has changed dramatically in recent years. Agents can no longer call utility companies to arrange transfers for clients - homeowners must do it themselves. However, this creates coordination challenges that agents must manage to prevent nightmare scenarios like families moving into homes with no heat or electricity.

**Core Principle:** You can't transfer utilities anymore, but you MUST coordinate the timing and remind both parties - it's one of the "little things" that endears you to clients.

## The Old System (No Longer Allowed)

### What Agents Used to Do

**Previous agent responsibilities:**
- Call PSE&G to register buyers for electricity
- Call to turn on water for buyers
- Call to turn on gas for buyers
- Call to turn OFF utilities for sellers
- Handled entire utility transfer process
- Complete coordination role

**Why this was convenient:**
- One phone call handled everything
- Agent controlled timing
- No risk of missed transfers
- Professional handled coordination
- Clients didn't have to think about it

---

## Why the System Changed

### The Safety/Liability Issue

**The problem that led to change:**
> "Now they don't let you do that anymore. The seller has to do it and the buyer has to do it."

**The specific danger:**
> "I could not like you today and I'm going to call up the PSE&G and turn off your heat."

**What this means:**
- **Anyone could call** utility companies
- **Anyone could shut off** someone's utilities
- No verification of identity
- No authorization required
- **Created potential for harm:**
  - Angry ex-spouse
  - Vindictive neighbor
  - Disgruntled agent
  - Identity theft

**Real dangers:**
- Shut off heat in winter → pipes freeze
- Shut off electricity → food spoils
- Shut off water → sanitation issues
- Elderly or children at risk

**The solution:**
- Only account holder can make changes
- Verification required
- Authorization needed
- Safety and liability protection

## Current Process: Homeowner Responsibility

### Seller Must Do

**Seller's responsibilities:**
1. Call to disconnect utilities in their name
2. Set date for utility shutoff
3. Provide final meter reading
4. Get final bill
5. Cannot be done by agent

**When seller must call:**
- Before closing
- With specific shutoff date
- Account in their name

### Buyer Must Do

**Buyer's responsibilities:**
1. Call to connect utilities in their name
2. Set date for utility connection
3. Provide move-in information
4. Establish new account
5. Cannot be done by agent

**When buyer must call:**
- Before closing
- Coordinated with seller's shutoff
- Account in their name

### What Agents CANNOT Do Anymore

**Prohibited actions:**
- Call utility companies on client's behalf
- Arrange disconnection
- Arrange connection
- Provide account information
- Make any changes to accounts

**What agents CAN do:**
- Remind clients to call
- Provide utility company contact information
- Coordinate timing between parties
- Verify calls were made
- Follow up that transfers happened

---

## Agent's New Role: Reminder and Coordinator

### The Problem Buyers Face

**Buyers have overwhelming task list:**
- Moving and transferring furniture
- Transferring bank accounts
- Changing cards and licenses
- Registering in new town
- School registration
- Doctor transfers
- **They may forget about utilities**

**The risk:**
> "You don't want a family with a young baby moving into a cold house. No heat, no electricity, whatever."

**Why this is agent's concern:**
- Client blames you if they forget
- Creates terrible moving day experience
- Damages your reputation
- Prevents referrals
- Shows lack of thoroughness

---

## Critical Timing Strategy

### For Sellers: The Grace Period

**Instructor's recommendation:**
> "Give another day or so even though they're paying another day. It would be nice. It's not a lot of money."

**The strategy:**

**Example scenario:**
- Closing on Monday
- **Don't shut off utilities Monday**
- **Keep utilities on until Wednesday or Thursday**

**Why this grace period matters:**

**Protection against delays:**
- Last-minute closing delays happen
- Inspection issues arise
- Funding delays occur
- **If closing delayed to Tuesday or Wednesday:**
  - Utilities still on
  - No emergency
  - Professional courtesy

**Minimal cost:**
- 2-3 extra days of utility cost
- Usually $5-15 total
- Small price for big protection
- Shows goodwill

**When to shut off:**
- Day after closing (for safety)
- 2-3 days after closing (for extra protection)
- Never on closing day itself

### For Buyers: The Sequence Problem

**The challenge:**
> "They usually can't get it turned on unless the seller calls to disrupt [disconnect] it."

**Why sequence matters:**

**The utility company logic:**
1. Account exists in seller's name
2. Property has active service
3. **Cannot create new account** until old account closed
4. **Seller must disconnect first**
5. **Then buyer can connect**

**Coordination required:**
- Seller disconnects on specific date
- Buyer connects on same date or next day
- Timing must be coordinated
- Can't have gap

**Agent's coordination role:**
1. Verify seller will disconnect day of closing
2. Verify buyer will connect day of closing or next day
3. Communicate dates between parties
4. Follow up that both happened

## The Nightmare Scenario to Avoid

### What You're Preventing

## Prevention: The "Little Things" That Matter

### Instructor's Philosophy

**The core lesson:**
> "These are the little things. These are the little things you're not going to learn in a regular training class, but these are the important things because they're the things that will endear you to your buyers and sellers because you're on top of everything."

**Why "little things" matter:**

**Clients don't know:**
- They don't know they need to call utilities
- They don't know the sequence
- They don't know the timing
- They've never done this before

**Lawyers often don't mention:**
- Attorneys focus on legal/financial
- May not mention utilities
- Assume someone else handles it
- Not their primary concern

**Utility companies don't coordinate:**
- They just disconnect/connect
- Don't care about timing
- No coordination between companies
- Automated systems

**YOU are the only one thinking about this:**
- Only one coordinating both sides
- Only one with full picture
- Only one preventing disaster
- **This is why you're valuable**

## Step-by-Step Utility Transfer Coordination

### Week Before Closing

**Action items for agent:**

**For seller:**
- [ ] Remind seller to call utilities
- [ ] Confirm which utilities need disconnection:
  - Electric (PSE&G, JCP&L, etc.)
  - Gas (if separate from electric)
  - Water/sewer (if municipal)
  - Trash collection (if applicable)
- [ ] Recommend disconnection date: Day after closing + 1-2 days
- [ ] Get confirmation they called
- [ ] Verify disconnect date scheduled

**For buyer:**
- [ ] Remind buyer to call utilities
- [ ] Provide utility company contact information
- [ ] Explain sequence (seller disconnects first)
- [ ] Recommend connection date: Day of closing or next day
- [ ] Get confirmation they called
- [ ] Verify connection date scheduled

### Coordination Communication

**Sample message to seller:**
> "Reminder: Please call to disconnect your utilities. I recommend keeping them on for 2 days after closing (Thursday) in case of any last-minute delays. Here are the numbers to call:
> - Electric: [number]
> - Gas: [number]
> - Water: [number]
> Please let me know once you've scheduled the disconnection."

**Sample message to buyer:**
> "Reminder: Please call to connect utilities in your name. The seller is disconnecting on [date], so you should schedule connection for closing day or the next day. Here are the numbers:
> - Electric: [number]
> - Gas: [number]
> - Water: [number]
> Please let me know once you've scheduled the connection."

### Day Before Closing Verification

**Final confirmation calls:**

**To seller:**
> "Quick confirmation - you called utilities and they're scheduled to disconnect on [date], correct?"

**To buyer:**
> "Quick confirmation - you called utilities and they're scheduled to connect on [date], correct?"

**If either says NO:**
- **Immediate action required**
- Have them call TODAY
- Emergency setup
- Follow up to confirm

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Reminding Clients About Utilities
- **Problem:** Clients forget, move into house with no utilities
- **Solution:** Multiple reminders week before closing

### Mistake 2: Not Coordinating Timing Between Seller and Buyer
- **Problem:** Gap in service or overlap issues
- **Solution:** Communicate dates between parties

### Mistake 3: Recommending Seller Shut Off Day of Closing
- **Problem:** If closing delays, no utilities for showing/access
- **Solution:** Recommend 2-3 day grace period

### Mistake 4: Not Verifying Calls Were Made
- **Problem:** Clients say they'll call but don't, discover on moving day
- **Solution:** Follow up for confirmation

### Mistake 5: Not Providing Complete Contact Information

## Summary

**The Utility Transfer Coordination Formula:**

```
Remind Seller to Disconnect (2-3 days after closing)
    ↓
Remind Buyer to Connect (day of closing)
    ↓
Coordinate Timing Between Both Parties
    ↓
Verify Both Made Calls
    ↓
= Smooth Move-In + No Utility Disasters + Happy Clients
```

**The Four Critical Rules:**
1. **You cannot call utilities** - homeowners must do it themselves
2. **Remind both parties** - they will forget without reminders
3. **Coordinate timing** - seller must disconnect before buyer can connect
4. **Build in grace period** - seller keeps on 2-3 days extra

**Remember:** This is one of the "little things" that clients don't learn about in regular training but makes huge difference in client satisfaction. Preventing a family from moving into a house with no heat or electricity creates loyalty and referrals.

**The Ultimate Goal:** Seamless utility transfer with no service gaps, no emergencies, and clients who appreciate your thorough attention to details that others overlook.

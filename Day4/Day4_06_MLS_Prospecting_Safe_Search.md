# Day 4 - Topic 06: MLS Prospecting and Safe Search

## Overview

MLS Prospecting (also called Safe Search or Buyer Portal) is a powerful tool that automatically sends listings to buyers AND allows you to see what they're REALLY looking for - even when it's different from what they told you. This intelligence helps you serve them better and close deals faster.

**Core System:** MLS Prospecting / Safe Search buyer portal

**Key Benefit:** You can see everything your buyers search for, revealing their true preferences

## Setting Up Buyer in MLS Prospecting

### The Initial Setup Process

**Steps:**
1. **Add client to MLS prospecting system**
2. **Fill out their criteria:**
   - Bedrooms (minimum)
   - Bathrooms (minimum)
   - Location/towns
   - School districts
   - Property type
   - Special features
3. **Keep criteria BROAD initially** to capture maximum options
4. **Ask the critical question:** Delivery preference

## The Critical Question: Delivery Preference

### What to Ask

**Script:**
> "Would you like to receive listings in real time, or would you prefer once a week? When I get listings, do you want me to send them in real time as they come up, or would you like me to send them to you every day, or would you like me to send them only once a week? How would you like it?"

### Why This Matters - Rafael's Story

**The Mistake:**
- Rafael (brand new agent) had buyer referred by her husband
- Desperate couple wanting to buy
- **Rafael's assumption:** "They both work very hard, I don't want to disturb them"
- **His strategy:** Only send listings at 6:00 PM after work

**The Problem Call:**
> Wife called: "I don't understand this. How come I can see it on Zillow before you send it to me?"

**What went wrong:**
- She wanted REAL-TIME notifications
- She never ASKED for delayed sending
- Rafael made assumptions
- **She felt he wasn't on top of things**

**The Fix:**
- Adjusted to real-time delivery
- Met her actual needs
- Restored confidence

### The Permission-Based Approach

**Key questions to ask:**
1. **"Do you want listings in real time, or would you prefer once a week?"**
2. **"If there's anything you like, give me a call and I'll make an appointment."**
3. **"How would you like me to work with you?"**
4. **"When is the best time to call you?"**

**Why this works:**
- You get PERMISSION to work a certain way
- Buyer understands your system
- No surprises
- No complaints
- **When you get permission, people appreciate your approach**

## Market Context for Communication

### In Hot Markets

**What buyers want:**
- Real-time notifications
- Immediate alerts
- Multiple daily updates
- Quick response to their questions
- **Speed = opportunity**

**Most buyers wanted this during recent market:**
> "In this market, they wanted to know everything real time."

### Rafael's Over-Aggressive Approach (Lesson Learned)

**Agent's perspective:**
- Rafael was sitting behind computer all day
- Sent every listing immediately
- Called within 5 minutes of buyer clicking

**Buyer's experience (student in class):**
> "He was on the ball. He was too aggressive. I was afraid if I hit [a listing], he's gonna call me in 5 minutes. I wouldn't even open them. I wouldn't even see the listings because I know I was gonna get a call - like three calls right back."

**The Problem:**
- Agent didn't ask preferences
- Assumed everyone wants immediate call
- Buyer felt pressured
- **Buyer AVOIDED engaging with listings**

**The Solution (Student Should Have Done):**
> "You should have told him: 'Do me a favor - could you only call me on Fridays?' Just call me only on Fridays or something like that."

**But the REAL solution:**
> "He should have asked you: 'How would you like me to work with you?'"

## The Safe Search Intelligence System

### What Buyers Can Do Through Portal

**Self-Service Features:**
1. **Search for homes** themselves
2. **See all listings** matching criteria
3. **Write notes** on listings
4. **Save favorites**
5. **Request showings** (depending on setup)
6. **Get automated updates**

### What YOU Can See (The Secret Weapon)

**The Intelligence:**
> "Guess what else they'll be able to do? They'll be able to search. So let's say they told you they only want to spend $700,000, and then you go in and you can see what they're searching for. And if they're searching for $900,000, you kind of know: Hey, they are looking for more like a $900,000 home. They don't know you can see it."

**What this reveals:**
- Their TRUE budget (not what they told you)
- Properties they're really interested in
- Neighborhoods they're actually considering
- Features they prioritize (based on searches)
- How active they are in the search
- Competitor listings they're viewing

### The "$700K vs $900K" Example

**What buyer tells you:**
> "We can only spend $700,000."

**What you see in their searches:**
- $850,000 properties
- $900,000 properties
- $950,000 properties

**What this means:**
- They CAN actually spend more
- They're being cautious with you
- OR they're dreaming/exploring
- **Time to have a conversation**

## Using Search Intelligence Professionally

### The Honest Approach

**When you see different search behavior:**

**Script:**
> "By the way, I saw your search. Is there anything in that price range you would like to see? I saw your search, be honest with them."

**Why honesty works:**
1. Shows you're paying attention
2. Gives them permission to be honest
3. Opens up real conversation
4. Prevents wasted time
5. Builds trust

### The Conversation

**You:**
> "I noticed you've been looking at homes in the $900K range. I thought you said your budget was $700K. Has something changed, or would you like to explore those higher-priced properties?"

**Possible Responses:**

**Response A: "Oh, we're just dreaming"**
- **Your reply:** "OK, let me know if you want to see what you could qualify for at that price. I can connect you with a lender."

**Response B: "Well, we MIGHT be able to go higher"**
- **Your reply:** "Great! Let's talk to your lender and see what's possible. I don't want you to miss out on homes you could actually afford."

**Response C: "We got pre-approved for more but didn't want to spend it all"**
- **Your reply:** "That's smart! So your ceiling is $900K but you'd prefer to stay around $700K? Let me search both ranges and we'll see what's available."

## Setting Up Effective Searches

### Broad vs. Narrow Criteria

**Start BROAD:**
- Cast wide net initially
- Capture all possibilities
- Let buyer see full range
- They can narrow themselves

**Example:**
- Buyer wants 3 bedrooms
- Set search for 2+ bedrooms (show them 3BR and 4BR)
- Buyer wants "good schools"
- Include multiple school districts, let them evaluate

### Auto-Send Settings

**Frequency options:**
1. **Real-time** - As soon as listing hits MLS
2. **Daily digest** - Once per day, all new listings
3. **Weekly summary** - Once per week compilation
4. **Manual only** - Agent sends individually

**Match to buyer preference:**
> "Do you want to see the listings as soon as they come up on the market? And they say yes or they say no. Do you want me to send it to you every day, or would you like me to send it to you only once a week? How would you like it?"

## Managing Buyer Notes and Feedback

### Buyers Can Write Notes

**On each listing they can:**
- "Love this one - want to see"
- "Too far from work"
- "Price too high"
- "Kitchen needs updating"
- Any personal thoughts

**You see these notes:**
- Understand their thinking
- Learn what matters to them
- Refine future searches
- Prepare for showing conversations

### Follow-Up System

**Your process:**
> "If there's anything you like or that you like, give me a call and I'll be happy to make an appointment for you."

**Be available but not pushy:**
- Check portal daily for their activity
- Note which listings they save/open
- Reach out based on their preference (call Friday, text anytime, etc.)
- **Respect their stated communication wishes**

---

## Adjusting Searches Based on Behavior

### When They Search Outside Parameters

**What to look for:**
- Searching different towns than discussed
- Searching different price ranges
- Searching different property types
- Searching different school districts

**Action steps:**
1. **Notice the pattern** (not just one search)
2. **Bring it up honestly**
3. **Adjust official search if appropriate**
4. **Don't be judgmental** - be helpful

### When They're Not Engaging

**Red flags:**
- Not opening emails
- Not clicking listings
- No searches on portal
- No responses to your sends

**Action steps:**
1. **Call or text** to check in
2. **Ask if search criteria are correct**
3. **Ask if they're still actively looking**
4. **Adjust frequency** if too many emails
5. **Ask what would be most helpful**

## Zillow Competition Management

### The Rafael Story Lesson

**What happened:**
> "Wife called and said: 'I don't understand this. How come I can see it on Zillow before you send it to me?'"

**Why this happens:**
- Zillow often faster than agent manual sends
- Zillow is automatic
- Agent may batch send (like Rafael at 6 PM)
- **Buyers compare your speed to Zillow**

**Solutions:**
1. **Set to real-time auto-send** if they want immediate
2. **Explain MLS is same source** as Zillow
3. **Add value beyond speed** - expertise, access, negotiation
4. **Acknowledge Zillow** but emphasize MLS accuracy

**Script:**
> "Zillow and our MLS use the same data, but MLS is more accurate and updates first. I've set you up to receive listings in real-time from MLS, so you'll actually see things before or at the same time as Zillow. Plus, I'm here to provide context, schedule showings, and guide you through offers - things Zillow can't do."

## Privacy and Transparency

### What Buyers Don't Know

**Most buyers don't realize:**
- You can see their searches
- You can see what they click
- You can see what they save
- You can see their notes (sometimes)

**Should you tell them?**

**Instructor's approach:**
> "They don't know you can see it. Be honest with them. I saw your search."

**Recommended transparency:**
- Don't hide that you can see activity
- When you reference it, mention it: "I saw you were searching..."
- Frame it as helpful: "I noticed you've been looking at..."
- **Use it to serve them better, not to "catch" them**

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Asking Delivery Preference
- **Problem:** Rafael's situation - buyer frustrated
- **Solution:** Ask explicitly how they want to receive listings

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Search Intelligence
- **Problem:** Miss signals about true budget/preferences
- **Solution:** Review their portal activity weekly

### Mistake 3: Being Too Aggressive with Follow-Up
- **Problem:** Rafael calling within 5 minutes, buyer avoided listings
- **Solution:** Ask "when should I call about listings?"

### Mistake 4: Not Using Real-Time in Hot Market
- **Problem:** Buyers see listings on Zillow first
- **Solution:** Auto-send in real-time when market demands it

### Mistake 5: Setting Search Too Narrowly
- **Problem:** Miss properties they'd love
- **Solution:** Start broad, let buyer narrow

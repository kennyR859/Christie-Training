## Pre-Listing Title Search: Critical Protection

### The Scenario

**When to use Regency pre-listing search:**

**You're listing a property and:**
- Looks like it might be underwater (worth less than owed)
- Could be short sale situation
- Multiple liens visible in public records
- Foreclosure rumors or notices
- Estate with unclear ownership
- Divorce situation with equity questions

### The Regency Service

**What they do:**
- Quick title search (not full title commitment)
- Identify all liens against property
- Calculate total debt vs. estimated value
- Determine if enough equity to close
- Report findings to you

**Why this is critical:**
> "You want your commission. You need to know if there's money to pay you."

**The financial protection:**
- Know upfront if seller can pay commission
- Identify if property needs short sale process

- Protect yourself from unpaid commission situations

### The Legal Liability Issue

**Court liability warning:**
> "If you tell another agent 'I'm paying 2%' but there's not enough money to pay them, court could decide YOU had obligation to tell them."

**The liability scenario:**
1. You list property
2. Promise 2% buyer agent commission in MLS
3. Another agent brings buyer
4. At closing: Not enough money to pay commissions
5. **Court could hold:** You made promise, you're liable

**The problem:**
- Other agent did work based on your commission promise
- They brought buyer in good faith
- No disclosure that commission might not be paid
- You could be personally liable for their commission

**Protection through Regency:**
> "Be very careful. That's why Regency is important. For all of us we have the right to call them. They will do a quick search to protect us."

**What the search reveals:**
- First mortgage balance
- Second mortgage or HELOC
- Tax liens
- Municipal liens
- Judgment liens
- Mechanic's liens
- **Total debt** vs. **expected sale price**
- **Available funds** for commissions

**Action based on findings:**

**If sufficient equity:**
- Proceed with listing normally
- Commission payment secure
- Standard transaction

**If insufficient equity:**
- Discuss short sale with seller
- Disclose commission uncertainty in MLS
- Get bank approval for commission
- OR decline listing
- Protect yourself from liability

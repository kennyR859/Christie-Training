# Day 4 - Topic 09: Contract Line 108 - Items Included in Sale

## Overview

Line 108 of the real estate contract addresses what items are included with the property sale. This seemingly simple line is actually a legal minefield that can cost agents thousands of dollars if handled incorrectly. The common shortcut of writing "as per listing agreement" creates dangerous legal exposure.

**Core Principle:** Be extremely specific on Line 108. List everything separately. Never rely on "as per listing agreement."

---

## The Dangerous Shortcut: "As Per Listing Agreement"

### What Agents Commonly Do (WRONG)

**The shortcut:**
- Line 108 says: "Items included in the sale:"
- Agent writes: "As per listing agreement"
- Agent thinks: "Easy, I'm done"

### Why This is DANGEROUS

**The legal reality instructor learned from attorney:**

#### The Listing Agreement is "An Offering to the Public"

**What this means legally:**

**The offering structure:**
1. Listing agreement = Private legal offering to the public
2. Lists items that WILL be included
3. **BUT:** This offering is ONLY valid if buyer accepts ALL terms

**The conditional nature:**
> "IF buyer pays exactly asking price + all terms → Items ARE included"

> "IF offer alters in ANY way (lower price, different terms) → Offering is VOIDED"

**When offering becomes void:**
- Buyer offers lower price
- Buyer changes closing date
- Buyer requests seller concessions
- ANY deviation from exact listing terms

**The result:**
- Original offering no longer applies
- Items listed may NOT be included anymore
- "As per listing agreement" becomes meaningless
- Legal ambiguity creates liability

### The Attorney's Warning

**Instructor's consultation with attorney:**
> "I am very, very specific on that line. Be very specific. If you're not specific, you may wind up paying for a dining room chandelier."

**What this means:**
- Attorney advised maximum specificity
- Listing agreement protection evaporates with changed terms
- Agent may be liable for missing items
- Seller may claim items weren't part of altered deal

---

## The Right Way: Be Extremely Specific

### List Everything Separately

**What to include on Line 108:**

**Lighting fixtures:**
- Dining room chandelier
- Kitchen pendant lights
- Entry way chandelier
- Bedroom ceiling fans
- Bathroom light fixtures

**Kitchen appliances (list each separately):**
- Refrigerator
- Stove/range
- Dishwasher
- Microwave
- Garbage disposal
- Wine cooler (if applicable)

**Window treatments:**
- All curtains and drapes in living room
- Blinds in bedrooms
- Shutters in kitchen
- Shades in bathrooms
- Custom window treatments in [specific rooms]

**Garage and outdoor:**
- Garage door opener(s) with remotes
- Outdoor storage shed
- Planters on front porch
- Garden statuary
- Basketball hoop

**Electronics and fixtures:**
- TV wall mounts
- Surround sound speakers (if attached)
- Security system equipment
- Smart home devices (if staying)

**Basement and special items:**
- Pool table in family room (if buyer wants it)
- Built-in shelving units
- Workbench in garage

**The rule:**
> "Everything - even if in listing"

---

## Special Case: Items Buyers DON'T Want

### The Pool Table Problem

**Instructor's note:**
> "Your customer doesn't want that pool table, put that down there. They're very hard to get rid of, by the way."

### How to Document Items NOT Wanted

**The statement to add:**
> "The customer does NOT want the pool table in family room."

**Why this is important:**
- Pool tables are expensive to move
- Sellers often want to leave them
- Buyers may not want them
- Explicitly stating "not wanted" prevents confusion

**Other items buyers commonly don't want:**
- Old refrigerator in basement
- Outdated furniture pieces
- Large outdoor equipment
- Children's playground equipment

---

## The "Once and Not Once" Rule

### What This Means

**Instructor's directive:**
> "All of that should be in there, very specific. Once and not once."

**Translation:**
1. **"Once"** = List items that ARE included
2. **"Not once"** = List items that are NOT included

### Why Both Lists Matter

**Items that ARE included:**
- Clarity on what stays
- Buyer expectations managed
- Seller knows what to leave
- No disputes at closing

**Items that are NOT included:**
- Clarity on what goes with seller
- Prevents buyer from expecting them
- Protects seller's belongings
- No disputes at walk-through

---

## When Buyers Want Items NOT in Listing

### The Scenario

**Example:**
> "Hey, we'll buy this house if they leave all the drapes in the living room."

**The problem:**
- Drapes are NOT in listing agreement
- Seller planned to take them
- Buyer wants them as condition of sale

### The Solution

**Add to Line 108:**
> "This contract is subject to the seller leaving the living room drapes."

**Alternative wording:**
> "Seller to leave all window treatments in living room, including custom drapes and hardware."

**Why this works:**
- Makes it contractual condition
- Seller must respond in attorney review
- Clear expectation set
- Subject to negotiation, not assumption

### Negotiation Strategy

**If seller refuses:**
- Buyer can withdraw during attorney review
- OR buyer can negotiate other terms
- OR buyer can offer to pay for drapes
- Clear, early discussion prevents later problems

## Wendy's Different Approach (Instructor Disagrees)

### Wendy's Method

**What Wendy does:**
1. Put "as per listing agreement" on Line 108
2. Then specify items in "Additional Contractual Provisions" section

### Why Instructor Disagrees

**Instructor's view:**
> "I love her, but don't listen to her. I think that's a conflict."

**Reason for disagreement:**
1. **Line 108 is the PROPER place** for items included
2. **Additional provisions creates conflicting locations:**
   - Line 108 says "as per listing"
   - Additional provisions lists specific items
   - Which controls if they conflict?
3. **Attorney advised Line 108 specificity:**
   - Lawyer said be specific on Line 108
   - Not "work around it elsewhere"
4. **Creates unnecessary confusion:**
   - Don't risk confusion between sections
   - Keep it all in one place
   - Clear and unambiguous

**The safe approach:**
- Use Line 108 for its intended purpose
- Don't create multiple locations for same information
- Follow attorney's advice for specificity

---

## What NOT to List (The Ridiculous Test)

### When Specificity Goes Too Far

**Instructor's example:**
> "You can't be ridiculous. Like if there's a pool that they don't want the pool."

**What this means:**

**DON'T list things that are obviously part of the house:**
- In-ground swimming pool
- Built-in cabinetry
- The roof
- The foundation
- Walls and ceilings

**These are attached to the house and stay by default**

### The Critical Distinction

**Attached vs. Not Attached:**

**Attached = Stays (usually):**
- Built-in appliances
- Light fixtures wired into house
- Built-in shelving
- Ceiling fans
- Attached mirrors

**Not Attached = Specify:**
- Refrigerator (usually not attached)
- Window treatments (can be removed)
- Area rugs
- Furniture
- Decorative items
- Outdoor furniture

**Ambiguous = Specify:**
- Washer and dryer (could go either way)
- Some light fixtures (chandeliers are valuable)
- Garage door openers (technically attached but often wanted)
- Mirrors (attached or just hung?)

## Real-World Examples of Line 108 Problems

### Story 1: The Missing Chandelier

**What happened:**
- Agent wrote "as per listing agreement"
- Listing included dining room chandelier
- Buyer offered $20K below asking
- Seller accepted lower offer
- **At closing:** Chandelier was gone
- Buyer: "But it was in the listing!"
- Seller: "You changed the terms, offering is void"
- **Agent had to buy replacement chandelier**

**What should have happened:**
- "Dining room chandelier" listed specifically on Line 108
- No ambiguity regardless of price negotiation

### Story 2: The Pool Table Nobody Wanted

**What happened:**
- Listing showed pool table in basement
- Buyers loved house but didn't want pool table
- Agent didn't specify
- Seller assumed buyers wanted it (was in photos)
- **At walk-through:** Pool table still there
- Buyers: "We don't want that, we have no room for it"
- Seller: "It's too expensive to move"
- Last-minute negotiation required

**What should have happened:**
- Line 108: "Buyer does NOT want pool table in basement. Seller to remove before closing."

### Story 3: The Refrigerator Confusion

**What happened:**
- Listing showed beautiful stainless refrigerator
- Agent wrote "as per listing agreement"
- **At walk-through:** Cheap old refrigerator in kitchen
- Buyers: "Where's the refrigerator from the photos?"
- Sellers: "That was ours, we took it. Listing didn't specifically include it."
- Dispute nearly killed deal

**What should have happened:**
- "Samsung stainless steel refrigerator (model #XYZ) currently in kitchen"
- OR "Refrigerator shown in photos NOT included"

## Action Items

- [ ] Create Line 108 template with common items
- [ ] Add Line 108 checklist to contract preparation process
- [ ] Practice being specific - write sample Line 108 for practice listing
- [ ] Consult with your attorney about Line 108 best practices

## Summary

**The Line 108 Formula:**

```
Review Listing + Photos Carefully
    ↓
Ask Listing Agent What's Included
    ↓
Ask Your Buyer What They Want/Don't Want
    ↓
List EVERYTHING Specifically on Line 108
    ↓
= No Closing Surprises + No Agent Liability + Protected Transaction
```

**The Three Cardinal Rules:**
1. **Never write "as per listing agreement"** - it creates legal risk
2. **Be extremely specific** - list every item separately
3. **Include items NOT wanted** - prevents confusion

**Remember:** If offer changes ANY term from listing (which it almost always does), the listing agreement offering becomes void. Only specific items in the contract are protected.

**The Ultimate Goal:** Create crystal-clear contract language that leaves no room for interpretation, protects all parties, and prevents closing-day disputes over items.

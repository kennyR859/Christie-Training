## How Remine Changed the Farming Game

### The Old Farming Method

1. Pick geographic area (e.g., 500 homes)
2. Mail to EVERY single house
3. Mail every single month
4. Cost: $500-1000+ per month
5. **Waste:** Many recipients just moved in, not ready to sell

**Problems:**
- Expensive
- Inefficient
- No targeting
- Hit or miss results
- Long ROI timeline (6-12 months)

### The New Remine Method

**Targeted approach:**
1. Use Remine to filter geographic area
2. **Filter for:**
   - 25+ years in home
   - Paid off or nearly paid off mortgage
   - High sell score
   - Age demographics (elderly)
3. **Result:** 500 homes becomes 50-75 HIGH PROBABILITY leads
4. Focus budget on these targets
5. Faster results, better ROI

**Advantages:**
- Cost-effective (smaller list)
- Highly targeted
- Data-driven
- Immediate contact info
- Multiple contact methods (mail, email, phone, text)

## Finding the "Little Old Lady" - Elderly Homeowner Strategy

### The Opportunity

**Instructor's explanation:**
> "How are you going to find that little old lady [to help with snow]? We're going to know how to do it tomorrow. By going into Remine you can filter anybody that's been in their home for 25 years, 30 years, 15 years, anybody whose mortgage is paid off."

### The Search Process

- Can be multiple non-contiguous areas

**Step 2: Apply Filters**
- **Time in home:** 25-30+ years
- **Mortgage status:** Paid off or nearly paid off

- **Age:** If available in data

**Step 3: Prioritize List**
- Sort by sell score (high to low)
- Look for recent online activity

## Remine for Farming

### Building Your 250+ Farm List

**Traditional farming rule:**
> "I recommend at least 250 people in a territory, usually right around where you live because people know you."

**Remine transforms this:**

**Scenario: Your Neighborhood**
1. Map area around your home
2. Apply Remine filters
3. **Result:** Only 25 high-probability leads (not 250)

**Solution: Expand Intelligently**
1. Add another neighborhood nearby
2. Filter that area → 50 more leads
3. Continue until you reach 250 total
4. **Your farm is now all over** but highly targeted

**Instructor's key point:**
> "Your farm doesn't have to be only in one location. Your farm could be all over the place."

### The Main Street Strategy

**Include a Main Street in your farm:**

**Instructor asks:**
> "Why do you think I want a Main Street incorporated in your farm? Why?"

**The answer:**
> "Because if you get a listing there, your sign is there and everybody that comes in and out and up and down and all around sees your sign."

**Example:**
- You live in Cresco
- Main street: Knickerbocker or Paramount
- Mail to EVERY business/property on that street every month
- High visibility when you get listing
- Maximum sign exposure

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Using Filters
- **Problem:** Too much data, overwhelming
- **Solution:** Use filters strategically to narrow focus

- **Solution:** Balance specificity with quantity (aim for 250)

### Mistake 3: Not Following Up
- **Problem:** Get great leads, don't contact them
- **Solution:** Create contact system immediately

### Mistake 4: Using Data Insensitively
- **Problem:** Reference personal info inappropriately
- **Solution:** Use data for targeting, not for weird personal comments

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Sell Score
- **Problem:** Treat all leads equally
- **Solution:** Prioritize high sell scores first

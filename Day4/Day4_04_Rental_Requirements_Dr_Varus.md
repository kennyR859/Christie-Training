# Day 4 - Topic 04: Rental Requirements and Dr. Varus

## Overview

Rental transactions require specific documentation, credit checks, and criminal history verification. Dr. Varus (also known as Docuvera Online) is the primary credit reporting system used for rental applications in New Jersey. Understanding the complete rental qualification process protects both landlords and agents from liability while ensuring compliant, professional transactions.

**System Name:** Dr. Varus / Docuvera Online

**Purpose:** Credit checks and criminal history for rental applicants

## The Rental Application Process

### Who Must Apply

**Legal Requirements:**
- Every adult living in the house MUST be on the lease
- Every adult MUST be qualified
- Age varies: 18, 20, or 21+ (check local requirements)

**Example:**

## Criminal History Checks

### Why Landlords Should Do Criminal Checks

**Instructor's key warnings to landlords:**

**Liability Issue #1: Personal Injury**
> "If they don't do the criminal history and this person happens to injure somebody, they could be liable."

**Liability Issue #2: Illegal Activity**
> "If they start making drugs in the house, they could be liable."

**Instructor's additional thought:**
> "I think they should do a mental health history too, but they don't."

### Who is Liable?

**Question from student:**
> "Who are they that could be liable? Docuvera or the agent?"

**Answer:**
> "Landlord. OK, yeah."

**Clarification:**
- **Landlord** is primarily liable for tenant actions
- Dr. Varus provides the service (reporting)
- Agent facilitates but is not liable for screening decisions

### The Legal Balance

**Compliance Requirement:**
- Landlords must follow Attorney General's memorandum
- Cannot be prejudiced or discriminate
- Must apply screening criteria consistently

**But:**
- Landlords CAN and SHOULD do criminal history checks
- Protects them from liability
- Must apply same standards to all applicants

## Landlord Education

### Key Points to Communicate

**The Liability Message:**
> "One of the things they have to understand is that if they don't do the criminal history and this person happens to injure somebody, you know... they could be liable. Or if they start making drugs in the house, they could be liable."

**The Protection Angle:**
- Criminal check is protection, not discrimination
- Applied consistently = compliance
- Better to know than to risk liability

**The Cost-Benefit:**
- Small fee for criminal check
- Huge protection from liability
- Peace of mind
- Safer property

### Fair Housing Compliance

**What you must explain:**
- Attorney General's memorandum on tenant screening
- Cannot discriminate based on:
  - Race
  - Color
  - National origin
  - Religion
  - Sex
  - Familial status
  - Disability
  - Source of income (in NJ)

**But can:**
- Apply consistent screening criteria
- Require credit checks for all
- Require criminal history for all
- Set income requirements (consistently)
- Check rental history for all

## Summary

**The Rental Screening Formula:**

```
All Adults Apply → Dr. Varus Credit Check → Present to Landlord
    ↓
Landlord Reviews → Conditional Acceptance
    ↓
Criminal History Check (if required) → Final Decision
    ↓
= Protected Landlord + Compliant Process + Professional Transaction
```

**Remember:** Your role is to facilitate professional screening that protects the landlord from liability while remaining compliant with fair housing laws. Dr. Varus is your tool for consistent, thorough tenant qualification.

**Critical Protection:** Landlords CAN be liable if they don't screen and something happens. Your job is to educate them and facilitate proper screening - it's not discrimination, it's protection when applied consistently.

# Day 4 - Topic 15: Lead Paint Certification for Rentals

## Overview

Lead paint certification is a relatively new requirement for rental properties in New Jersey, mandating inspection every 2 years or upon new tenant occupancy. Most landlords are unaware of this requirement. As the listing agent for rental properties, you must educate sellers, ensure compliance, and upload certification to MLS to protect all parties from serious liability.

**Core Principle:** Most landlords have no knowledge of this. Educating them and ensuring compliance is your job.

## The New Requirement

### For All Two-Family and Multi-Family Rental Properties

**Mandatory lead paint certification:**
- Must be inspected every 2 years
- OR upon new tenant moving in
- Whichever comes first

**Who it applies to:**
- Two-family homes with rental units
- Multi-family properties
- Any residential rental in New Jersey
- Built before 1978 (when lead paint was banned)

### The Process

**1. Landlord arranges inspection:**
- Hire licensed lead paint inspector
- Schedule inspection of rental unit(s)
- Inspector tests for lead paint hazards
- Focus on deteriorated paint surfaces

**2. Inspector tests and evaluates:**
- Visual inspection
- Paint chip testing
- Dust wipe testing
- XRF analyzer testing (some inspectors)

**3. Certification issued:**
- If pass: Lead safe certification
- If fail: Must remediate and re-inspect
- Valid for specified period

**4. Landlord provides to tenant:**
- Copy of certification
- Disclosure of results
- Information about lead hazards

**5. Agent gets copy for listing:**
> "Agent must get copy for listing"

**6. Upload to MLS:**
- Required document in listing
- Proves compliance
- Protects all parties

## Two Types of Certifications

### Option 1: Standard Lead Safe Certification

**The two-year certification:**

**Process:**
- Visual inspection
- Testing of deteriorated surfaces
- Assessment of lead hazards
- Certification if safe

**Cost:**
> "Less expensive"
- Typically $300-$600 depending on unit size
- Per unit pricing
- Standard industry rate

**Validity:**
> "2 years"
- Must re-inspect every 2 years
- OR when new tenant moves in
- Ongoing compliance requirement

**Re-inspection requirement:**
> "Every 2 years OR new tenant (whichever comes first)"

**When to use:**
- Most common option
- More affordable upfront
- Suitable if turnover expected
- Landlord plans to continue renting

### Option 2: Full Lead-Free Certification

**The permanent certification:**

**Process:**
> "Take plugs from walls to test for lead"
- Much more invasive testing
- Core samples from painted surfaces
- Tests through all paint layers
- Lab analysis

**Cost:**
> "More expensive"
- Typically $800-$1,500+ depending on size
- More labor intensive
- Lab testing costs
- Higher upfront investment

**Validity:**
> "If no lead found → FOREVER"
- Never needs re-inspection
- Permanent certification
- Property certified lead-free

**No re-inspection needed:**
- One-time expense
- Never expires
- Transferable to new owners
- Best long-term value if property is lead-free

### The Inspector's Warning

**The reality of old houses:**
> "Any house prior to [1978] has lead somewhere in those layers of paint. It could be 10 layers under, but it's there."

**What this means:**
- Lead paint WAS used before 1978
- May be buried under newer paint
- Multiple layers of paint on old homes
- **Very few homes will pass lead-free certification**

**The practical implication:**
- Most pre-1978 homes have SOME lead
- Full lead-free certification often fails
- Standard 2-year certification more practical
- Focus on lead hazards, not complete absence

## Where Lead Problems Occur

### Primary Problem Areas

**1. Woodwork with cracks:**
- Window sills
- Door frames
- Baseboards
- Crown molding
- Any cracked or peeling paint

**Why this is dangerous:**
- Cracks create chips
- Chips contain lead
- Children eat chips
- Direct exposure pathway

**2. Windows (Opening and Closing):**
> "New replacement windows: Usually no problem"
> "Old windows: Shedding layers of paint when opened/closed"
> "This is where most exposure happens"

**The window friction problem:**
- Window opens and closes
- Paint rubs against paint
- Creates lead dust
- Dust falls on sill
- Children touch sill, then mouth
- **Primary exposure pathway**

**Old windows vs. new windows:**

**New replacement windows:**
- Vinyl or modern materials
- No paint friction
- Minimal lead exposure risk
- Usually pass inspection

**Old original windows:**
- Multiple paint layers
- Friction when opening/closing
- Lead dust generation
- High exposure risk
- Often fail inspection

### Secondary Problem Areas

**Porches and railings:**
- Exterior paint deterioration
- Weather exposure
- Peeling and chipping

**Stairs:**
- High traffic areas
- Paint wear
- Friction points

**Exterior siding:**
- Old clapboard
- Peeling paint
- Weathering

## Agent Responsibilities for Rental Listings

### When Listing Two-Family or Multi-Family

**Step 1: Advise landlord of requirement**
> "When listing two-family: Advise landlord of lead paint certification requirement"

**What to say:**
> "New Jersey requires lead paint certification for rental properties every 2 years or when a new tenant moves in. Have you had this inspection done? If not, we need to arrange it before listing."

**Education points:**
- Explain the requirement
- Explain the two options (2-year vs. permanent)
- Provide inspector referrals
- Explain timeline

**Step 2: Get copy of certification**
> "Get copy of certification from landlord"

**Verify certification:**
- Is it current (within 2 years)?
- Does it cover the rental unit(s)?
- Is it from licensed inspector?
- Does it show passing results?

**If no certification exists:**
- Must arrange inspection before listing
- OR list but note "pending lead certification"
- OR advise seller to complete before marketing

**Step 3: Upload certification to MLS**
> "Upload certification as a document in MLS listing"

**Where to upload:**
- MLS document section
- Label clearly: "Lead Safe Certification"
- Include date of certification
- Make available to all agents

**Step 4: Make available to potential buyers**
> "Make available to potential buyers"

**How to provide:**
- Mention in listing remarks

## The Reality: Most Landlords Don't Know

### The Awareness Gap

**Instructor's observation:**
> "Most landlords have no knowledge of this. A lot of them don't."

**Why landlords don't know:**
- Relatively new requirement
- Not well publicized
- No active enforcement (yet)
- Word hasn't spread
- Didn't exist when they bought property

**Your job:**
> "Your job: Educate them, Make sure they comply, Protect them from liability"

**The value you provide:**
- Inform them of requirement
- Explain the liability
- Arrange compliance
- Protect from lawsuits
- Professional service

## Liability for Non-Compliance

### What Can Happen to Landlords

**Landlords can be SUED if:**
1. They don't get certification
2. They don't provide it to tenant
3. Tenant or tenant's child has lead exposure

**The legal exposure:**

**Scenario:**
- Landlord doesn't get certification
- Doesn't provide to tenant
- Child lives in unit
- Child develops elevated blood lead levels
- **Landlord is sued**

**Potential damages:**
- Medical costs
- Remediation costs
- Damages for injury
- Punitive damages
- Attorney fees
- **Massive liability**

**Prevention through compliance:**
- Get certification

### Cost Considerations

**Remediation costs vary widely:**
- Minor repairs: $500-$2,000
- Moderate remediation: $2,000-$5,000
- Full abatement: $10,000-$30,000+

**Factors affecting cost:**

## Selling Rental Properties: Lead Disclosure

### Federal Lead Paint Disclosure (Pre-1978 Properties)

**Always required for pre-1978 homes:**
- Disclosure form about lead paint knowledge
- EPA pamphlet to buyers
- 10-day inspection period option (if buyer wants)

**This is SEPARATE from rental certification:**
- Federal law applies to all sales
- State law applies to rentals
- Both may be required
- Don't confuse the two

### Marketing Advantage

**Properties with current certification:**
- Shows professional landlord
- Reduces buyer concerns
- Smoother transaction
- Less liability
- Commands better price

**Properties without certification:**
- Buyer discount expected
- Buyer uncertainty
- Longer due diligence
- Potential deal-killer
- Negotiating weakness

- **Solution:** Understand these are separate requirements

### Mistake 3: Not Uploading to MLS
- **Problem:** Buyers don't know certification exists, repeat questions
- **Solution:** Upload to MLS documents section

### Mistake 4: Accepting Expired Certification
- **Problem:** Certification must be current (within 2 years)
- **Solution:** Verify date, arrange re-inspection if needed

### Mistake 5: Not Educating Landlord About Liability

## Summary

**The Lead Paint Certification Formula:**

```
Ask About Certification at Listing Presentation
    ↓
Educate Landlord About Requirement and Liability
    ↓
Arrange Inspection if Needed
    ↓
Get Copy and Upload to MLS
    ↓
= Compliant Property + Protected Landlord + Informed Buyers
```

**The Two Certification Options:**
1. **Standard (2-year):** Less expensive, must repeat, most practical
2. **Permanent (lead-free):** More expensive, one-time, rarely achieved in pre-1978 homes

**Remember:** Most landlords have no idea this requirement exists. Your role is to educate, ensure compliance, and protect them from massive liability from tenant lawsuits.

**The Ultimate Goal:** Every rental property listing has current lead paint certification, uploaded to MLS, provided to buyers, and landlord understands ongoing compliance requirements.

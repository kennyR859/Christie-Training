# Day 1 - Topic 08: Circle Prospecting & Door Knocking

## Overview
Circle prospecting is one of the most effective ways to get listings, especially for new agents. This technique involves introducing yourself to neighbors when you get a listing, hold an open house, or make a sale. This guide covers the psychology, technique, and success strategies for door knocking.

## Why Circle Prospecting Works

### The Statistics
**National Association of Realtors data:**
> **86% of people list with the FIRST person they speak to.**

**Key insight:** You must be first.

### The Neighborhood Effect
**Real estate psychology:**
- When one house sells, **3 others in the neighborhood typically come on market within 1-1.5 years**
- Neighbors get the idea when they see activity
- You're planting seeds for future business

### Competitive Advantage
**Surprising fact:**
> "Major teams don't do circle prospecting. They're waiting for social media to do everything for them."

**Your opportunity:**
- Open window for new agents
- Less competition than you think
- Established agents are lazy about this

## The Psychology: Door Knocking vs. Doorbell Ringing

### Critical Distinction

**Door Knocking:**
- People who know you or recognize you
- Neighbors, family, local community
- Less threatening
- More natural

**Doorbell Ringing:**
- Complete strangers
- Cold calling in person
- More formal
- Can be intimidating

**Why it matters:**
> "In this area, people are really afraid. Nobody rings doorbells anymore. Door knocking sounds more real."

### The Three-Knock Technique
**Why three knocks work:**
- Sounds like a friend or neighbor
- More casual than doorbell
- Less startling
- Feels personal

**DON'T:** Ring three times (sounds urgent/scary)
**DO:** Knock three times with natural rhythm

## Circle Prospecting Strategy

### When to Do It

**1. When You Get a New Listing**
- Introduce yourself to neighbors
- Announce the listing
- Invite them to open house

**2. When You Hold an Open House**
- Invite the neighborhood
- Bring flyers with property info
- Create excitement

**3. When You Make a Sale (SOLD)**
- Announce the success
- Build your credibility
- Position yourself as the area expert

### The Numbers: How Many Doors?

**Standard pattern:**
- **5 houses on each side** of your listing
- **10 across the street**
- **Total: ~20 houses**

**Adjust based on:**
- Neighborhood density
- Cul-de-sacs
- Apartment buildings (do you want to canvas entire building?)

## The Script

### Your Approach

**Body language:**
- Have materials visible in your hand (not hidden)
- Stand BACK from the door (people are cautious)
- Smile and be relaxed
- Don't rush

**What to have ready:**
1. Business card
2. Open house flyer OR listing information
3. Your Christie's presence (confidence)

### The Opening (30 seconds)

**Basic script:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name] with Christie's International Real Estate. The reason I'm knocking on your door today is I have an open house down the street on Sunday and I wanted to invite the neighbors. I have a copy of the listing here with the flyer. [Offer to hand it to them or slide under door]"

**Key elements:**
- State your name clearly
- Mention Christie's (credibility)
- Give specific reason for visit
- Offer immediate value (flyer/info)
- No pressure

### If They Engage

**Listen for buying signals:**
- "Oh, I've been thinking about selling..."
- "How much did it sell for?"
- "What's the market like right now?"
- "I know someone who might be interested..."

**Don't interrogate - have a conversation:**
- Answer their questions
- Offer to provide market information
- Give your card
- Suggest staying in touch

### If They're Not Interested

**Graceful exit:**
- "No problem! I'll leave this information with you."
- "If you know anyone thinking of moving, I'd appreciate the referral."
- "Have a great day!"

**Leave the materials** - They might look later

## Advanced Techniques

### The CRM Integration
**When circle prospecting:**
1. Knock on doors OR leave materials
2. **Immediately add to CRM** with notes
3. Note: "Circle prospect - [Address] listing"
4. Set follow-up for 30 days
5. Send market updates monthly

**Example: The 3 Siblings Story**
- Knocked doors for circle prospecting
- Discovered: Parents deceased, 3 siblings preparing house
- Added to CRM immediately
- Sent market studies through Platform
- **Tracked** when all 3 siblings opened the study
- ~30 days later: All 3 opened it same night
- Called next morning: "Ready to list!"

**Result:** Got the listing

**Lesson:** Circle prospecting + CRM tracking = Perfect timing

### Town Regulations
**Before you start:**
- Check with town hall about sign ordinances
- Ask about solicitation rules
- Some towns require permits for door-to-door

**Most towns:**
- Allow neighborhood notifications for open houses
- Allow listing announcements
- May restrict "For Sale" signs on public property

**Pro tip from instructor story:**
> "I put my open house sign on the front steps. They can't do anything to me for putting that sign on the front steps."

**Police brought sign back to agent:**
> "People in Franklin Lakes can afford GPS. Keep your signs."

**Warning given:** Be aware and respectful, but also strategic.

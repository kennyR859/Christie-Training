dell carnny To To Trust You and How to Do It is the book How to Win Friends and Influence Other And every other trainer that's any good has based their training on him he is he is he is excellent There is ability it just it came to me this morning that's so crazy and now we can't find It


Let's print it out for you you know they are the cheat codes for becoming magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic i'm trying to say a word not in a look at me way yet people just feel good around you you know I liken it to puppies you know for those I hope there's nobody here that doesn't like dogs but I like them puppies no matter what your puppy is going to love you no matter what you do and you've got to get people by smiling by they want to work with you You'll make sales not by your knowledge of the real estate market of course you have to have that But you'll make sales by people wanting to be with you that is enjoyable that they like you they trust you and they have faith in you so so you know you have to be genuinely interested in them you have to learn to listen more than speak And all these sales people have this one here and that fear is that you won't know how to answer a question You just won't know and then all of a sudden your confidence level's lost you know I remember once when I first started out driving a customer's customers came in your car and I was driving around and the husband said what is the population of this town I have no idea it changes all the time anyway you know and so I all of a sudden felt my confidence level drop because I didn't know so I have an answer for that we have answers for that the one thing you're going to do when you take your 1st customer out and by the way this can happen pretty soon you know if you do what we're doing you can get your customer out pretty soon The one thing you do is you go into platform or you gotta learn about platform too and we'll have Mark do that for us and are is any did any of your admin put you on platform yet you have the app for platform good OK go into platform and by the way there's the Academy make sure every night you take one of the courses on the Academy and platform but go into at turf and at turf you can say I'm showing you how some Ridgewood I'm showing a house in Montclair i'm showing a house here I'm showing a house there and you can download all the pertinent information on that if that that town where the shopping center is where the schools are where where everything is right and prepare a booklet so so from that day I learned I didn't have platform and I didn't have any access to that but I did have the town information because you can go town into the town's website and you can get the population the demographics and will income you can get everything so anytime I took a customer out from there and I downloaded that printed it and put it into a folder for them on each tab and that's what you should do you should start practicing that take the town that you work in Hoboken go into the towns website print out the town the information on the tap it'll have demographics it'll it'll have everything there is average income you know the population and have that printed out and put it in a nice folder then go into at turf and platform and print out let's say just print out where the stores are where the schools are where you know anything you want to print out about that town so it can print out stores it can print out shopping centers it can print out schools coffee shops almost anything you want bicycle shops anything you want you know can be you choose what you want there's a menu and you print it out and you put it in your folder and then you have that for every single customer that wants to look at mobile but maybe you have a customer that wants to live in West New York do the same thing and and then when your customer comes to you you say oh you know I have prepared or you can email it to them before they come I have prepared all the information you may need on this tab and then they don't have any questions then you start asking the questions So from now on in this class every statement you all make when we do role play has to be in the form of a met in the form of a question and and why do we want to do that anybody know keep the conversation Yeah you have to keep the conversation going because if you make a statement it just goes right over everybody says by the way almost 50% of what I say is going to grade over your head that's why people come back you know and when we were doing it on Zoom which we will be doing unfortunately Marcus got to be doing things on Zoom in person we used to help here in person but we can go up to when it happens we can go up to the model office which I know is a hike for some of you but it's about 10 minutes from here and he's doing the Zoom up there and then sometimes at 5% you only absorb about most people only absorb about 5% on super so so anyway and where you do learn the most almost 90% is by teaching each other by communicating with each other exchanging ideas if you're working on something during this course share it share it so everybody can understand if we have a new agent that maybe has a listing coming up let's share the process let's go through it and so that that's how you really learn and that's why the in person learning works the best of all so OK so you're downloading Bill Carter II say to you I'm probably a better auditory auditory listening nerd and reader because I'm always moving and I keep it in my car and on my phone so I would download that you know to your phone if you can amazon has it it's not expensive so get your checklist together and by the end of this week make have made an appointment to get your is your platform together so everybody's got their that all set up what about you you're all set up on platform this is impressive you are you guys I know are because usually classes have both how many have their bios done OK value propositions OK 5 seconds do it on here right so so here's some of the values that Dale Carnegie says that is important Let me get where does the bio and value proposition go Oh that is going to go into your personalized listing presentation and on the website And that's why you need a picture and you need oh I almost forgot something you need at least three testimonials now brand new people and they were testimonial i've never sold the house it can be a testimonial can be from anybody can be from your mom could be from your best friend it could be from anybody all we want to do is show that you are a charismatic lovely person to work with that you are intelligent you are smart you are you know you are generous in your with your time and you care about people type thing you know so put all the attributes you can think that belong to you yeah yes can I use reviews given to me at a dealership yes absolutely and I will so you you in in a bio is where you might want to make the transition or connect the lines between your well I want you to be very careful because people are making the biggest investment they ever made most likely yes OK they don't want a part time person OK so be really careful but you can say that that type of service that you gave you are bringing now to the real estate industry It says it has a pass and as a present as a as a you know as a part dealership I did this this this this is the thing that I'm doing It's it's very very hard to convince somebody to you know you have a lot of competition out there there's no doubt about it but you bring a fresh new viewpoint to real estate and that's what you want to want to pursue making that clear that yes this person has sold a $2 million worth of real estate in two weeks you know but you have the time and the energy you know and you bring a different different you basically bring a different expression to the real estate industry you bring your own personal caring and knowledge and and every not everybody likes everybody you know you say how can I compete with this person well not everybody likes that person so there's a door for you to open a window for you to you know to open so don't be afraid of the competition but be aware of that be aware that the competition is mighty you know when I started in real estate this is funny to see a room full of men you know more men than women when I started in real estate I was the only woman in the office and I never intended to start in real estate I was in our major college but my girlfriend wanted to get her real estate license and asked me to come with her so I went with her you know and then before I knew it I was in real estate and here's the training I got I you had to get on the phone every day for two hours and make calls from you don't even know what it is it's called the Yellow Pages they might still have a Yellow Pages it's a book a telephone book with everybody's telephone number in it and we called and the second day I was there I got AI got somebody said yeah they 'd like to sell their home And I went to my broker and I said I got somebody that wants to sell their home what do I do and he said don't leave without the listing he gave me this one page piece of paper and went there and I left with the listing by 11:00 at night I got in the office the next day this is how bad communication was in those days once a week you would get a big file with of listings and let a document stating which ones were sold in which work and you had to keep this book up all the time it was wine bottle in this book and my broker called me and I thought he was calling me in to congratulate me he said you know what you listed a house that was already listed And I said Oh my gosh and he said don't worry the the listing brokers had it for six months and he said he doesn't you know he said let her have it and just give me a referral for you it was very nice and I sold it the next week so he must have been kind of annoyed but but he wasn't he was a very nice man so so calls are where it's at making Sorry making making those calls is very important but my point is that there were no women in the industry and soon years later it became a female dominated industry and I am so happy to see men back in the industry I mean I think it really helps the industry it balances out the industry II think it's it's very very important but when I was there I can remember this one and I'm not being prejudice by best friend is Greek but this Greek man came in very Greek man from Greece and he I was on the floor we had floor and he came in and it was my turn to take that customer so I took him out in the car and he said isn't there a man I could work with he said no you're stuck with me you're in my car he bought a house for me that day so so you're going to find different things don't get annoyed with them just try to win the people over as well I'm saying I could have gotten angry and gone back to my boss and say this man is prejudice and whatever no my goal was to help him no matter what he said my goal was to find him a house no matter what he said and I did and that's what that's the attitude you have to have so so again welcome men that's great So now today what I'm going to do in a little while I'm going to give out contracts We have a lawyer coming she's just confirming it for me either to this week this week or next week coming in to go over the contract again usually I do it myself but this as a lawyer that is looking for business probably and wanting to spread her name but she's also got an excellent reputation jeanette from Edgewater loves her and she's offered to do some classes on contract law But I do today is I'm going to be giving you out a contract for sale and then what I want you to do is to fill it out blindly you know no questions asked don't call me about it just try to figure it out by yourself and then because if I do it with you then tomorrow and where is there something you don't understand just you know put a mark on it highlight it whatever and two ways even just to let you know even though we do that for two days and it's probably the most boring two days you're going to have what I find is like this week Cynthia cynthia made two offers guys oh good yeah and there were parts of the contract she still you know even though we went over it and that will happen to you you know you will so I usually say in the class to do this fill it out But I'm finding that you need to do it again and again so you can go on zip forms you can don't just don't send it anywhere and you can fill out contracts and I think you need to do it because the biggest fear I found some agents have it is that Oh my God they're going to buy a house i'm going to do the contract Afraid of success you know fear of success by the way guys is huge I had one agent I used to own my own company and I had one agent who was very successful people loved her you know they wanted to work with her but every time she sold a house she was all upset instead of being excited she was upset she's so much you have to do afterwards she was so afraid of the stuff you have to do afterwards that it held her back you know once we kind of relieved her of some of that you know then she flourished she was just afraid she couldn't handle it all and there is a lot of paperwork and but there is an easy way to handle it There is an easy way to handle which we never had your contacts it's called the CRM and it works out great so as we go through this course you were supposed to actually have 100 people in your CRM I said that out to the managers I don't know if you did or not but try to keep filling it out little by little when I developed this course for Iliad I decided the best way to do it was to go around to some of the most successful agents and ask them what is it that they wish they had done when they first started in real estate what is the number one thing they wish they had done And their number one universal answer was that they wish they had kept every single contact somewhere not on I had agents that used to put their contacts on paper plates I saw that not on a napkin not on a piece of paper not I don't know used envelope but in your CRM believe me it will pay off there will be customers that you will have that you may not sell for five years but you will sell them someday somewhere their life changes they can afford more they inherit something you know it it so always keep them and your CRM to work for you You know your content you can set up an automatic contact every so often it makes life so much easier so much easier so start filling in your CRM start putting it in because if you gather thousands and then you have to put it in impossible it's an impossible task so slowly but surely keep adding and it can be anybody anybody you talk to you know your dry cleaner just talk to them give them your card you know where you shop whatever you know your spirit if we're going to go over today the different forms of marketing your sphere of influence is probably the number one for sale a lot of people make and that your sphere of influences people you know The second is circle marketing and that is the best way to get a listing right now and 3rd is a farm OK so a farm is an expensive process for you guys he's doing a lot of your circle marketing probably is a lot less expensive and your sphere is again easier because it's all people you know and so we'll go over that a bit today and let me let me take a minute what time is it it's eleven thirteen i'm gonna just take a minute and get the contracts out of here and pass them out whoopsie Daisy.


docuvera

Because it might be the first thing you do rentals might be the first thing you do I will have somebody come in and go over all the new rental rules but I'll touch on it briefly just so you know about it and he goes over the rules and condo Co-op rules and the rental rules we use Dr Barris as AA vehicle to give to our clients to fill out and make sure we get their credit report and their history the law has changed I don't know if you're aware that you probably are aware but if it's the same in Georgia the law has changed here where originally we were able to get a criminal history on tenants we are not now we can in the in the future so once the landlord would accept the contract the list the agreement that we give them that we then can ask them if they want to go they have to send out an A traditional acceptance of the lease it's getting really complicated so bring the landlord a lease application with Dr Varus backup saying that they basically are qualified and then the landlord can say okay I accept this person conditionally and but I do want to do a criminal history then they go back to Dr Barris and fill out and then the criminal district can come you cannot bring the criminal history nor will they do it you don't have to worry about making a mistake because Dr Barrys will do it without the criminal history So I think that and the criminal history goes back about five years and the criminal history goes back about five years. To you as Let's say you're renting a place or you're listing the place a landlord has to update their lead paint assessments every two years and it can be everyone year if a tenant moves out after one year it has to have to come back in again and have a letting assessment after the 1st year so that's really important what's happening in the future is going to be a vote for rentals and for residential real estate is a each town is assessing a lead pipes going into the town into the home from the town and making them having them removed and this is a really expensive procedure I think most of the towns right now will be making an assessment the town will do it hire somebody to do it and there will be an assessment place on the homeowner or probably in their taxes so but right now they're they're out there designating which which ones they think have led pets probably going to be Paul Richard you know or any well established over town so that is going to be a lovely mess anyway I so any questions on that at all I can assure you I have many clients in the past that I have sold investment properties too and I've made sure I have made them aware of the fact that these changes are in place The homeowners don't know it they had you know I had one client In fact that is what I want to tell you about rentals I have one client who was a rental He then I then sold him A to fit he his wife had two family home I sold them another 2 family home and I sold them a 3rd home that they're living in and I called her actually I sold her 32 families I called her to retell her what was going on they have no idea When it comes to the lead paint I went into a few of the towns building inspectors they don't name part of it They passed the law with no vehicle to support the law so homeowners are on their own And I went to several towns you have somebody that will do that we don't want to hear about it and so slowly but surely they are go....ts so we'll see I haven't seen it yet And so slowly but surely they are going to start complying from what I understand hiring somebody in the towns to do lead faith assessments so we'll see I haven't seen it yet but anyway . 


So on a listing on a residential it used to be random as to whether the homeowner had to fill out a homeowners property you know properly information statements now it's the law that just became a law every listing that you take has to have homeowners the homeowners information document which will be A whole load of questions and answers for them to fill out you may not assist them in that now here's where the danger comes in The danger comes in when it's an older couple they don't remember when they blessed with their roof on they don't remember how old the heating system is they don't they just don't remember there was an opportunity on that document to say they don't know make sure you tell them that because because it used to be it was a buyer beware law it used to be that when somebody closed on that property they had a home inspection It's the doors closed they can't go back after the home but now that document if it's wrong gives them an open door to go to take them to court so protect your buyer your sellers make sure you say look if you have no idea whatsoever just say I don't know a state situation where the person is the executor for an estate and has never lived in the house they just just say I've never right on the document I've never lived in the house right Children who who may have lived in the house when they were young but haven't lived in it in 40 years I have never I have not lived in the home in the last 40 years and they have no information so be careful with that document and when the lawyer comes in and have her explore that war with you And the most important thing you know is that you cannot sit down with them and write it out you're not allowed to'cause then you're going to be involved right so the other document that will be important for you to make sure you have signed when you're taking out buyers is the Buyers agreement you all know about the friend




buyer's aggrement

In 11 part yeah why do you think it came about eventually we didn't want to pay We want to cut that down The second document is the fire agency so a couple of years back it was like two years ago what we were doing was on a listing agreement you would see what your Commission would be I'd say two and a half percent to buyers broker so the Department of Justice they feel that we're price fixing and that's part of this situation and so a young attorney out in I can't remember was Michigan or wherever felt that thought that buyers sellers were not aware of the fact This is brand by the way We were not that they were not aware that when they paid a Commission to their listing agents that the buyers agent was being paid by them too They weren't aware that they were paying the buyer's agent I'm not sure I know how that could be since we actually have a paper piece of paper that's a part of the listing agreement you'll see it where it explains it it did explain how much was given to the buyers broker so they said that it wasn't fully understood by the seller so they sued the National Association of Realtors and Bro because that for a tremendous amount of money and then a settlement occurred and in the settlement that was a lot of money exchanged but in the settlement it basically said no longer could we put if I list a property I can't put the and we can't we're not even supposed to call it a Commission I can't put the compensation out to you all you have to guess or your opportunity here where the opportunity comes in as Randy has always said is that now you can put in anything you want So I decided to test it So what they were saying we should do is I put out a listing item and they're basically saying that the buyer broker should be paid by the buyer and the seller's broker paid by the seller So now you are asking and you are being prejudice there's no doubt in my mind against FHA and BN virus and lower income you are being that that is I'm sure they're going there's going to be another lesson about that So what they're saying is because now if you get a VA no down buyer and they have to pay the broker where they don't have the money from right NFHA 3% down where are they going to get the money back for the buyer broker so it wasn't functional at all and it was so what they said was that was the fact that's what we had to do so your choice was then to call the take your have your customer sign this document as to whether they would pay the Commission or not and as an opportunity for you to say they're not paying the Commission but that your Commission would be 2 1/2 percent 3% whatever you want to put up there a lot of agents now are getting 3% as a buyer And the reason for it is I think that prices like starting prices are they asking price right now so if there's a house that comes on for 700,000 it's going to sell for 8 Yeah and so the highest bid wins so if the highest bid happens to be a broker that's asking for 3% but it still Nets the seller more than the other beds they're going to take it and pay it so I decided to test it and II don't solicit customers anymore I just deal with friends and old customers so just so happened a friend of my son's parents called me and said you know we want to buy a house with our kids so I had to deal with this whole process and this is you know and so I wrote up the contract I did not call the listing agent ask what the Commission was compensation was going to be I just put down 2 1/2 percent And so she took my contract she called me back and she said well they like your offer but they're not paying 2 1/2 percent they're only paying two and they say well I charge 2 1/2 What do you think happened They accepted because my offer was $100,000 over their asking price there were multiple offers and so so basically when you really think about it the buyer has always paid the Commission anyway right because if the buyer didn't bring the funds to that closing table and it's their funds and banks there will be no commissions to pay right so the buyers really always paid it the seller really never really pays it it's just a part of the transaction it's a it's a cost of the transaction so keep that in mind and the best way to write an offer when you're writing a contract right now is to put your fee in as to whatever you want to put it in are there times when you may have to take 2% because the the numbers are too close and you're not competing Maybe but don't sell yourself short i'm going to tell you if you guys take this on seriously and you become a full time agent you're going to work hard Cynthia from the last class has already two offers it and she's I believe she's on up city that's why so that's another thing you want to go on to up city anybody here in Up city or no but Up city is Sammy will be coming here and he will go over how you get on opcity I recommend you don't do it until this class is over but but you should join it you can join it almost halfway throughn..




UPcity

And there's some of the agents there say oh don't do it it's a waste of time So you said that now the buyer pays the buyer's agent or without well that's what the law had said they were supposed to do that yeah but now when we go out to get listings right what agent is not going is going to show a house where they're not getting a compensation and their buyer says I can't pay I can't pay the fee I just have enough money to close and my down payment I can't get a fee so so we have found that we have not run into any seller who said they wouldn't pay the fee And if you do run into them how would you overcome it What would you say Let's say I decide Nick I'm going to hire you but here's the deal Nick I don't believe I should pay the buyers broker I'll I'll give you 2 1/2 percent but I don't want to pay any buyer and what would you say to me We're not going to buy the house though well no you're the virus agent and you are a virus agent but you're listing a property you don't have a buyer yet so and and your bot your seller said to you Nick I'll list with you but I don't want to pay the Commission to the buyers agent We're not hearing very much of this at all anymore but we'll really a much less competition from the buyers and probably we won't be able to sell on your asking price and I cannot waste my time with you so we can't do but but you can say look you know you can say look let's let's put this in the proper perspective and again make it a question say do you think then that all of the agents out there are going to bring their buyers to your home if they're not going to be paid And the reason you want it to be a question is because with Dale Carnegie by the way that's his reasoning you bring a person to the proper thinking through a series of questions that make them think more logically not emotionally but much more logically you know so let's say there's 3000 Asians out there with customers for your home which could create a huge interest in your home and and perhaps increase the value increase the kind of the offers you're going to get and if they are not being compensated what should we do how would we encourage them to come right And you know and the other thing you can say what what do you do for a living you know would you be work would you be going there every day if you weren't being compensated So so you you just have to make sure that you know how to overcome these objections so here's another fun trick When you get time I'm giving you a lot to do tonight but when you get time you can go into AI into Jet GPDAI and ask them for a list of objections and answers to a for a realtor who's going to be listing the house why you know and and they'll do a verbal back and forth with your work you know not verbal written thing or they I think it can be verbal too I don't know but they'll come up with all objections so the fun thing for you to know is that you will be one of your jobs will be to overcome objections and you overcome them by asking questions you know so you can do that with selling a house say you know I'm a listing broker I want to know all the objections that a seller could make to me in fact make it even harder i'm a brand new listing agent i'm a brand new real estate agent can you give me a list and of objections and answers to those objections


Do not let A buyer or a seller or a renter To think you're only doing this for this is a very emotional business by the way guys To do doing this for your own benefit and if you can get in your mind that you're doing this and only work this way work that you're only doing this to help somebody believe me the Commission's come like crazy They do and they're big you know so you're only doing this to help people and if you can get that in your mind and work from that aspect people will say if you're out there trying to sell a house and you're only counting on the Commission guess what That people will absolutely sense it you know they'll they'll be they'll they'll know they'll know so you have to be able to be aware of their needs and their wants and the only way you can do that is again through a series of questions so here we go test this out.
\
\
And if you put all your information in there that's what will actually come up on zip forms you don't send this ever to a buyer or seller Thank you OK So if you just get to that one tonight I'll be happy that's the most important one because there are some things that aren't evident on that that we will go through and then we will go over tomorrow how to build the perfect contract you want to you know contract doesn't necessarily mean the amount of money or the timing it needs the other services that you're going to provide with that contract what the follow through you're going to do what other values there are So what is aside from price if you were selling a house if you were a seller what would be important to you aside from price and and qualification time what else condition the condition no you're selling the house now OK OK so let's say you're selling a house and you are looking at aside from price and aside from the pre approval which you have what other conditions on that contract would be important to you already mentioned time That's important because sometimes people in the early spring don't want to close till June kids in school sometimes they want to close faster amount of down payment mountain payment yeah what what time will be responsible for Like it's some records are for example and I'm SAL and after a time that people will have some more information and they will suit me for Okay i'm not sure say that again I property I may have some liens on the property was after time when new owner can soon well what will be my responsibility Yeah that's interesting but mostly our title work is title insurance we hear so we don't have to worry about that that's a very good point But we have title insurance which covers you for and you'll have a title company come here by the way it covers you for anything like that any anywhere there was something needed some lean on the House that we didn't see So what else solutions like detail for example the house to stop is coming with which is so details of the property no now you're the list you're the owner OK you're the owner and and you want to know You want to know what would make you happy OK already established the timing the amount down the pre approval but what else Contingencies Yeah incumbents and anything that's any contingencies so how can we make those contingencies such as appraisal home inspection how can we make them better And you know what this buyer is putting down 50% how do we know where that money is Maybe proof of funds especially if it's an old cash deal you absolutely have to have proof of funds how do you get it the buyer sends you his bank account with redacted Social Security you know OK so anything else It could be a situation where the seller wants to sell let's say the seller wants to sell in June it's May not me it's it's let's say we're in March and people want to close right away because they're they're afraid mortgage rates might go up they can go up they can go down or for some reason they want to close on it early but the seller doesn't want to leave Can we use a use in occupancy Let this seller stay there but we're closing on it because maybe the mortgage company will only hold their loan for 30 days you know and in order for them to hold it any longer they have to increase they have to make another payment you know so it might be that so if there's a use in occupancy you might say the seller will accept the fact that the buyer will close on it but let them have a use in occupancy until June right there's so many things that could be created What else Home inspection could be limited right perhaps the home inspection could be limited instead of a full out home inspection it could be limited to mechanical environmental and structural And that means like if there's marks on the wall we don't care about that if there's a little crack in the window we don't care about that we only want to investigate the big things right so that's something that would help a seller make them feel more comfortable That's written in the offer that's what you will write in the offer OK OK So you're right we only do the limited inspection so there's a paragraph in the contract that says additional contractual provisions and tomorrow we'll go over that where you write that in but think about those things you need to think about and you can think about more maybe you have more ideas right appraisal Now these homes are all selling for $100,000 dollars over asking do we have appraisal gaps sometimes yeah yeah what's an appraisal gap difference difference between the price we're paid and the price that the bank says it's worth and and so a person can say who has plenty of extra cash or money or resources that I am not making it subject to an appraisal This offer is not subject to appraisal and I will pay any appraisal cap that there might be Could be a lot right if it's a lot what do you have to do Make sure that they have those funds ask for the proof of those funds you're working for the listing now right You're working for the you are the listing agent and you're working with your homeowner and you're trying to figure out what is the best contract for them so you're looking these over and you see one comes in says no appraisal now people think that because they say it's not contingent upon an appraisal that there won't be an appraisal of course there is an appraisal there's always an appraisal if there's a mortgage involved always always always and so it just means that if the bank says the house is worth 750 and you your offer is 8:25 that there will be this $50,000 gap no $75,000 OK let me say all right and then then you have to look at that offer and you have to say OK we like your offer understand you're doing making up the appraisal gap can we see where you have the proof of funds for that you have a bank account without my 20th to make up the difference This is all very important because you you you are when you're working for the listing agent I mean when you're working for the homeowner and you are their agent you are their guide because they don't know this they don't know a lot of this now what if a person says to you you're jumping over to the buyer's side or you can still remain the listing agent and the contract comes in and says OK they will make up the appraisal gap but up to only to $50,000 and then your seller has again you want to prove the funds and your seller has to say well OK let's I think it's going to appraise anyway but I'll take that and if the deal if it if they can't pay that in the bank over under appraisals then can we challenge it yes does it ever work hardly hardly and then they would just lower their price right Is bank appraisal similar to the tax no assessment no the value the bank appraiser does the basically the same thing with the same information that we do and when we do our CMAS is it usually higher than the tax assessment yes OK tax assessment if you look when you go into the MLS and you pick up a listing you can go over with those little boxes are and you can pull up the taxes or now it's on the top i'm sorry the old ones are you just hit taxes and it'll give you all the tax assessment and then if you look over there is the value on the land there's the value on the House and then the total assessment and then over to the right usually is the number called the equalization ratio and what that means instead of a town having to do evaluation and assessments every so many years they pick a number that they say OK this house is assessed at $500,000 but the equal legislation ratio is 80% saying that that five $100,000 is only 80% of its value it's never right It's never right And which reminds me OK this is something you need to write down because this is where you little dangerous supp let's say yourself there's so many


------

And they put them on the market before they're assessed by the town so you'll see this gorgeous colonial that was built on the foundation of a ranch and they are saying the taxes are $10,000 but they're really going to turn out to be $29,000 You have to be aware of house don't make that mistake that seller will buyer will say Oh my God you lied to me why didn't you know what the taxes were going to be And how can you find the taxes you really can't You can you can talk to the town you can talk to the tax assessor they'll kind of give you an idea The closest you can come is to find a similar home somewhere in that town in that neighborhood and what their taxes are and just kind of guess 'cause you won't know until the tax assessor goes out and they will never ever give you a number They won't commit themselves to another so just be careful of that one that is a dangerous thing you have to say to the person look you know the taxes are this way but they're not real you know it's just like when you sell sell a new home that hasn't been assessed nobody knows what the taxes are right So be really careful with that Your job is to question and then check you know sometimes you have to be basically a detached joke So seller says to you 0 these are my taxes What are you going to do Say do you have a copy of your tax return or do you have a copy of your your bill from the town and and then go to the MLS and go on the tax records and check it Because that's the worst thing you can do is put a mistake on your list right and errors and omissions will cover us to a certain degree As long as it looks like you're not being stupid and not doing your job you know it may be a point where they think hey wait a minute this person could have known this informationn

3 more open houses You know in in we have such limited inventory now it's a fight to do open houses you know but you want your broker to be able to say to the listing agent look why don't you why don't you pick Dmitry to do open houses why don't you you know and and that is a great way to get leads Absolutely Fabulous way to get leads let me just tell you about my accountability story again brand new And oh and this goes back to up City which was funny it was a really funny story because I had no idea what I was doing And everybody put their customers on little pieces of paper that had a backing and it printed what is that called again that paper that blue paper where you write on one side and it prints it on the other side I don't think people use it anymore I never been talking about Well so so Is





Used to have a managers meeting with all his people which I didn't even go to one yet because I wasn't I had just started and any customer you're not working with it or you don't want to work with anymore throw in the box And he didn't and he had a good reason for doing that if you accumulate customers that you're not selling by the way it has a mental effect on you you're better off thinking I sold four people that I'm working with rather than thinking I have 50 people and I only sold four you know this is a mental game you have to be very aware of the psychology of sales so so II know agents out there in this office not in this office but this company that's 8080 leads on up city It's not good I said get rid of them give them back give them back because you need to focus on the ones that are good that you've already established are good and you have a relationship with but anyway so they threw them in the pack some of them were from a year ago some of them were from even longer six months a year year and 1/2 there were people that had been disregarded and for some reason they weren't ready those agents weren't bad they were good agents it wasn't the agent wasn't good it was that the person wasn't ready yet So a sale anybody here a gardener at all no no gardeners here no gardener I love gardening planted seeds in the ground and that's what the fire when they first start looking is a seed in the ground and then you have to nourish that you have to water it and feed it expose it to sunlight and slowly it becomes a flower or something that's what the process of a sale is like person calls you they may not be ready they're just looking you know and slowly by nourishing them and working with them sometimes it does take a long time before they're ready for some reason some people are very methodical about their search you know they want to make sure they see everything they want to know everything they they need you to educate them so so anyway these people were obviously not ready All of us just there in the right time and it was in the right place But there was one guy Mr Pope He was the only one I didn't sell but he would come out every single weekend through the week after work anytime I wanted if he would come out And it was the weekend and it was Friday and I had an accountability session with my broker and I had to go in and say look I don't have any appointments this weekend I don't have any open houses this weekend I have nothing and I didn't want to do that so I figured oh heck I'll call Mister Pope call to Mr Pope of course he came out so I go to my broker who was named Don Terrace at the time and I said well I have one appointment only with Mr Pope OK that was my accountability can I tell you my family that weekend was in the Hamptons and I knew Mr Pope wasn't gonna buy it for me I was pretty sure and they would not have called him to go out on a Saturday or a Sunday unless unless I had an accountability session so I had it I didn't want to be a liar I took Mr Pope out and guess what happened he bought a house that weekend so I'm telling you accountability works even if your manager feels like they're too busy for you insist on it that's what they're there for they're there to help you that's their main job Insist on meeting with them welcome to know you you have an office with 60 people 70 people perhaps depending on where you are they got to get to know you too they have to you know want to help you and encourage you so help them help you right OK we are going to take.




Somebody wants to see a house in Greenwood and you're out of out of Edgewater and you don't see it on New Jersey MLS what would you do First of all you can find every listing on Zillow right no matter what you can find it then what would you do because now you're thinking your customer wants to see it you don't have a lock box for that that house called the listing agent called the listing agent and say look I have a customer would like to see it I don't have access to that lock box can you meet me there or can is the homeowner there and can let me in right What if they say no Raise the window break in the window break in the window by the way I did do that once I didn't break the window They were joking I know but I didn't do that it was a vacant house and somebody years ago there was a lot of nonsense that went in somebody must have had a customer that wanted the house they took the key out of the lock box there was no key in the lock box by the way always ask your customers on your listing Could you be that you want to make two extra keys the key to the house and two or 3 keep 1 in your car at all times don't label it just give it a number keep it in your car at all times keep one in the office at all times and one in the lock box because sometimes just by accident the person forgets to put the key in but so I get to this house the person is dying to see that they said oh we love this house we want to buy it and I walk around to the back and it was a little Cape Cod in Westwood and a little deck off the back and believe it or not the kitchen window is open I climbed in and I sold that house but somebody took the lock the key out of the lock box but of course in those days I was quite young so I could climb in windows Anyway you'll have funny stories I also walked on it you know with a lock box I rang the doorbell always ring the doorbell even though there's a lock box you know make sure nobody's really home I don't know why they don't do it anymore but they use MLS used to give out these little circles that a homeowner could put on the door say do not use lock box i'm at home They don't have them anymore you know and there was nothing there so I opened the door walking i'm showing the house and open the bathroom door and the guys in the shower I've also shown the wrong house and it was very cute it was I was showing houses to this guy and it was like so many houses and every time he came he was so proper he had shiny shoes you know and I knew I was showing kind of new construction but there was also one house he wanted to see that wasn't And I got the numbers mixed up because sometimes I would show 7 or 8 houses you don't do that anymore but people came and they wanted to see as many as they could so now you try to tell them look that doesn't really work you're going to miss them all up and you're not going to remember the house so try to keep it to 4 at most I think you know and unless you have a transferee then you're with them from breakfast to dinner and you're showing the world but anyway I should live in the house up this street then on the same street there was another house and I must have mixed up the numbers I go down and we're going into this house and it was one house was new construction so I got stuck in the mud you know you get stuck in the mud so when you're going to show new construction make sure you wear don't wear high heels ladies you know wear reasonable shoes anyway and you know my shoes were covered in mud I didn't have high heels on but my shoes were covered in mid and and then he takes out his hanky and he starts wiping my shoes and I'm like so embarrassed that probably you know reverse the number and we go to the next house and this little old man opens the door And I introduced myself and my customer and he said oh thank you you know come in and I went all around the house showing this and as we're leaving he said to me could you tell me why you're here And I said yeah well I was hoping to sell your house he goes but my house isn't for sale but he was very nice so so crazy things like that will happen and maybe not so much to you as me when I was so naive you know but anyway I learned to make sure my numbers were right And you know it it should be fun you know showing houses should be fun so always make it fun OK what i'm going to do now is dimitri is in a situation that you will All






And then we're gonna go over what he should do as his follow up I'll tell you the very beginning my initial interview with the broker manager Jeanette and Edgewater she said if you show up to the office and you put in the work like I'll you know I'll hook it up basically so I was going into the office every day even though I had nothing to do was pretending like I had something to do I would just feel you been open house for me it was like great so she took me to the listing umm gave me a tour full rundown took all the notes and then I had my first open house this weekend by myself completely by myself so it was I definitely wanted to throw up driving there so nervous like what are they going to ask me you know whatever but honestly the 2nd that I did it that was Saturday I did it again on Sunday and there was literally a line out the door like I'm not kidding people were waiting as I was doing one showing people were knocking on the door and I was like oh can you give me two minutes because that's also something else she told me don't show people the house like all together somebody might point out something else and then the other person might be like oh I don't like it either so that was great and there was two other open houses in the building the agents were waiting there and 1 of them was like I've been in real estate 17 years like look at you look everybody wants to see your listing you know so that was funny but don't get discouraged it'll be fine you'll get the hang of it But Fast forward I sent the follow up emails yesterday to everybody I had I had AQR code which was through platform I put it in a nice little picture frame and I told everybody please scan in as soon as they came in so all their information got saved right away email if they're represented by a broker phone number everything so I did the follow ups yesterday and then somebody returned the email This morning saying that they want to see more properties so I said to Fern like nowadays other than other than other than showing them more properties like they never signed the buyer's agency agreement because I didn't feel comfortable the second they walked into the open house like hey can you sign this well the law the law is that they don't have to sign a property they don't have to sign a buyer's agreement at an open house OK but at an open house we make it really clear you may not sell the house to anybody you only show the house you're working for the seller right And you tell them that you can That's right you do not have to do it furnace right at the open house but you should not have by our agency agreements done at an open house all right first on you're not supposed to do any transaction business at the open house the open house is just an open house to expose it to the public and see if there's interest if there is interest or somebody writes a contract you will do it after the open house now my training is coming a little longer but II hear you join open houses now are a little further down the road after the training well you can do it sooner because I think that that's going to happen a lot now OK how many are doing open houses already no not this vote this group over here is and I know I think I think Cynthia is going to be doing one i'm pretty sure yeah OK if you're doing an open house the government set up the law to state that's what you do you do the open house for the seller and that's it you do not work with buyers at that open house you do not get contracts anything I will give you a folder I don't know if you've got the folder with you or not but I'll give you a folder where you can zip it up and hide everything in there including your laptop and your phone and it will be hidden what happens when they show when the investigators show up at the open house there were 33 new investigators hired for Northern New Jersey to check us out make sure we're doing the right stuff and it's easy to do the right stuff you just don't have any papers there you just show the house see if there's any interest tell them I can help you right after the open house you can have contracts in your folder you can sit down and write them out right after the open house you can do it in the house except it has to be if it's one to 4 it would have to be 4O1 and the door has to be closed to the public all right if they want to see another house then you must do a buyer agency agreement but you you do have that leeway on the open house and the governor said you're working for the seller and if they do want to buy that house or they do want to make an offer for that house you can do it after the open house without a buyer the buyer agency agreement all right actually there was something else that came through II don't want to money to water too much but when you are the primary listing agent and you're going to lead your obligation is to share that house whether you have a signed agency agreement or not Wait say that again you're the listing agent I have one 1st Street for sale I get this call I want to go see the house An obligation to show that house for the seller because you're the primary listing agent you do not have to sign the buyer agency agreement in oh when did that happen it came across I zoom earlier
 oh when did that happen it came across I zoom earlier oh when did that happen it came across I zoom earlier






And here's the other thing is whenever you have an open house if it ends at 3 it ends at 4 You're always going to have stragglers should you allow somebody to come in after that time then the open house is still open so it's best to close up leave and go to a cafe or something or the office and write it up see what I'm saying so you're not tempted to open the door for anybody What if they're like well I don't wanna wait until three or can they give the offer like orally over the phone you can't even talk about an offer during that time frame and be careful because everyone is right there's testers out there To me it's ridiculous but what can I say no I get it Somebody wants to make an offer and you can do it till after three and they don't want to wait We could do it before the open house or after the open house but not during the open house if you do that that's a violation of the law they will pull your license and fine you the biggest fine we think is $15,000 big time don't do it so somebody says I want to make an offer at 12:30 I tell them you have to wait until after say listen right now I've done the open house where will you be at one minute after three Or you have somewhat the best thing is to have two people on that open house yeah number one for your safety and for the owners Peace of Mind you have more than one person one person could leave that open house all right and go to the office and do the contract that's right so one person could all right during the time of the open house you could leave and go to the office to do it what somebody has to stay at the house somebody has to keep the open house And it was a really I don't know why it would be that urgent because you have an attorney review and if there's other offers in there you're going to compete I mean the urgency and I would tell them listen there is a we can do it right after the open house I can do it for you I can sit with you where you're going to be I I'd be happy to you know to to do that for you and they say well we're going to catch a plane and this and that and the other they like to put it in now and so forth you're going to have to get the pre approval you've got to make sure they're qualified and all of that all the documents that can be signed I would say go off site take them off site if you can get to their your office that would be great you can sit down you've got lead page you've got sellers disclosure that's required by law and by the way the new rule will be you must load or upload the lead paint in the source disclosure when you upload the listing you'll have 24 hours to do it or they can pull your listing yeah and there's still many out there that aren't uploaded well they're not going to be that way Now because the MLS will will have to temporarily yeah I just read that slide show that you put opportunity

Open house 

listing agent






Contract or anything to do with with a contract at that open house our governor has a bad attitude he thinks that we're going to jump all over them and push them into a contract and make them buy the house That's exactly what he thinks and that's what a lot of other people in the legislature thought because they voted the bill They think that we pounce




Withdraw from the contract you're done however that's not the way the legislature shall If they want to put an offer at 3:00 301 Wednesday over the phone they can do that right over the phone no not verbal you don't do verbal offers well then we would draw it up or you have yeah you have to do the paperwork but they can say like I want to make an offer $1,000,000 over the phone and then I put it on and then extended time you're going to have to go through the process going to have to go through and you're going to have to get the pre approval our proof of funds if it's all cash you've got to have that certain documents in order to reset it your offer will not be presented by the other agent until we have these documents all right it's like I'll simplify it's like doing the lease you're not going to write a lease without an application and a credit report right well you can't write a contract without pre approval and the right documents you know you've got to have them all together so you got to make sure that you're doing business not lucky business and keep in mind that the way you pr....g to accept a verbal offer so you can
 and keep in mind that the way you present it to somebody is it really is no benefit to you because nobody's really going to accept a verbal offer so you can and keep in mind that the way you present it to somebody is it really is no benefit to you because nobody's really going to accept a verbal offer so you Can




 And First off if it is a Chrissy's listing it covers us all whether you know the people whether you know the agent whether you know the house we are in a dual agency position because they hire Christies they don't hire just one agent they hire the company therefore every agent in that company is in that producer responsibility If you're selling something in Montclair that's listed by one of our agents in the Montclair office you're a dual agent but if I don't have a buyer's agency agreement with that person that I'm showing the house to and they want to put an offer where are you now at an open house yeah let's say I'm at an open house right and they they're going to meet you after the open house and they want to make an offer you don't need it buyer's agency 'cause they came to the they came to the but how do I know what my percentage is or I will tell you that tomorrow but what we do is we we put 3% on all of our contracts you can always go down you can't go up and I was just that zoom in there's still a question by a lot of agents out there well what if they're offering more than I had the contract for tough stuff boys that's all you work and I'll give you an example I had a friend of mine call and say just I've got somebody who wants to sell the house with her brother down I looked at it signed it up and I signed it up II i'm old fashioned I asked for a full fee which I consider 6% and so I put it in 6 offering out offering up 2 1/2 right yes that writes the contract for two that's all she had put on her fire agency agreement so I got 4% and I was like yay you know but you can write three and I'll tell I'll tell you what I told my agents you can write 3 you can write 4 you can write whatever in there but a minimum of three because you're not calling everybody before you showed your house all right let's face it you're going to show the house see if they're interested then you can call if you want ahead of time to see what they're offering in compensation I don't care what they're offering anyhow what am I worth i'm still worth that amount of money and you put it in and if your offer is the highest and best they get the most net they don't care They're going to pay you a lot of a sudden about half of my agents were coming to me and saying for giving us the full fee I said well you asked for they should pay you you know like this to me is so simple and so real buyer agency is the best thing that could have happened to us we got a raise all of my agents got a raise because people what was happening was the listing agent was taking the listing and dictating what you could get all right you can put it in now and ask for what you're worth And it works quite often you're getting what you're worth because you're going out there and you're giving them an offer that needs their needs and they're saying and particularly in multiple offers when they're going like 5060 a 100,000 over ask right the guy looks and said I want that fire and I want that agents buyer pay the agent to bring it in you know it's a Barbara Corpren she did this many many years ago she said if you want the highest offer that's it and the agent well my servant to get you the highest offer take it and don't turn it down We had one recently and said well I don't want to pay it and said do you want the offer Do you want that much money for your house yeah pay it before they walk and buy somebody else's you know use common sense with this this is this is really basic simple all right they want the most money They are willing to pay you to bring your best buyer at their best price Don't don't sell yourself short I saw one recently I almost fell off my chair when I saw it but there was a negotiation prior that led to a very low fee and I said So what are you going to do for it you've got to do full service because that's my office and that's this company you got to pay for this and you got to pay for that you're not going to have any money.




However the way you get around it is I put it on the front steps they can't do anything to me for putting that sign on that front steps all right and that that works most of your towns have very strict sign ordinances it's part of the MLSI think if you go in there into the library you can see it and it will tell you what it costs to get the sign permit to put on the sign and if they're what the regulations are for having open house sides and stuff like that check it out I had the police covered bring me my side I just and I did that it was the house was in a 2 cul de sacs and I put one out by the main road there by the grocery store OK and I put it out there to show that you go up the development this way mm-hmm And then you get up into the development you go this way and then and I did it and they come bringing me the signs and they said people in Franklin Lakes can afford GPS keep your side keep your signs so I got they didn't find a warning So all your signs by the way you have to check in the town when you get a listing and then you go into my Syraci you know in platform or into platform to my psychology and you can order your sign Every request you have is in my sire G right signs your ad your advent should sit with you and go through it because that's her job or his job to pick up your request and process them or make sure they get to the right spot all right so take time to go your your admin should set up your templates in zip form all set up that means when you go to the for sale doc folder all the documents are there for you you don't have to go and pull the management everywhere they'll be there for you you will have listings sales leases and one other category I always forget the last one but rentals rentals that's that's that's correct rental listings rental listings so you have those four they'll set that up for you and they'll set up your dashboard so that and and walk you through the dashboard and tell you what they need to process your transaction because according to the policy that we have been given in our admins have been given they cannot go but so far with your transaction unless you go into the dashboard and put your documents and all of this stuff they they are required to do that why are they required state law and we are all being audited locally to make sure that we have the documents and if they go in and they pull my folder and I'm missing documents I want to be called in and like why why don't you do your job right you know that type of thing so you don't want to want that to happen II had that happen as a broker with one of my agents and they picked a good agent a really tough agent and they went to her file and they said this is perfect went out the front door but that's what they can do because they you know zip they could open it up and they can look and see if you took the proper documents and have them properly signed so you know just take it take it seriously it's easy stuff you know don't be lazy those those are the people who get caught the lazy ones who want to take shortcuts just do what you're supposed to do and put it behind because you're going to have to do it anyhow before you get paid so just yeah we we we I think I think I think I'm trying to think of it christina's still doing the looking over at the everybody's to make sure we're in compliance she had Christina Givens has Oh Christina we have heard Donald Donald Trump and so forth that are reviewing your files all right before your Commission check is written so if you're missing a lead paint you won't get your check because we have to have it you have to have it as Well it it is absolutely the law you know you you you the law is there to clean up our transactions and it's good if you run a clean transaction you're going to be around you're on sloppy transactions and lazy you're not going to be around long you know it's it's a simple simple premise OK I'll see you tomorrow yeah great and thank you very very much you're welcome










But you want the two bedroom with New York City view not interested in co-ops nowhere building whose budget is 650 Oh boy like meanwhile the one unit that I was showing this weekend was a one bedroom and a den with a New York City view listed at 999 so that's OK that's OK you'll just have to make yeah now you now comes the counseling session The counseling session is look I can't find anything that meets all of your needs Which of your needs would you compromise on Is there another town is there another area that he could look in Is there an older building that you could find anything and then I would show him three or 4 pull up three or 4 in his price range and send them to him and see what he says right yeah eventually you know that happens at open houses people come in and they don't know the value of the open house you know they don't know what's going on and then maybe find another area where you know it may be a newer building but it doesn't have New York City views Yeah So what happens after an open house is now all if you do it right if you do it with the QR code and that was easy for everybody everybody you know you show them all check in yeah I would always bring do the QR code thing but I would also there's three ways you can do it the sign in process the QR code you can have your laptop designated to have them fill in their information on platform at the at open application or you can just have piece paper and a pen and have them sign in the old fashioned way you may get people who don't know how to use AQR code you may get people who didn't bring the phone in you may get people you know so the old fashioned sign in way is perfect then you can actually upload them into your CRM if you do your CRM and you want it to automatically send them thank you for coming it will do that that night I don't know if you did that yeah it's it was automatic mark showed us how to do that OK yes he did and he will show you all how to do that so it's great because after an open house sometimes you may have somebody who wants to see something else you might be busy you forget to send them a thank you for coming the next day you got busy at work and believe me you will be busy and life gets in your way and now it's three days later and they forgotten you you've forgotten them and nothing went out right and now you're embarrassed So there is a very easy verbage to use when you have neglected somebody which happens to us all and now you're embarrassed to call them just say hey you know I'm just giving you a call because you know I've been thinking about you i'm so sorry we haven't been in contact I've been thinking about you keep a lot and just use that it overrides that I haven't called you into 10 years you know so so just use that verbiage the the I'm going to want to make sure that you guys get on your way to do the things you need to do because so tomorrow we were going to go over contracts and we may start it depending on how long Randy's presentation is still try to fill them out but then worst case scenario we do it on Thursday and and tomorrow I will go over this lock box thing with you all so I would I would make my calls to to the MLS if you don't have a lock box into Garden State and get your lock box set up because you never know when somebody's going to call you a friend might say hey I heard you in real estate things you need to do what are they BIOS value statements BIOS and value statements just do the contract that's for sure by the way let's say somebody let's say he changes his mind because you might find a Co-op with that not newer but at least with some views right and he doesn't want to call up and let's say he finally says 0 yeah I guess I have to buy a call up what would you use would you use any of those documents You didn't use that contract The attorney will do it but what you have to use in the beginning is an offer to purchase it's a letter of intent why it's in our zip forms as a offer to purchase rather than a letter of intent I have no idea but they're the same thing and you they are not buying real estate they are buying shares they're buying stocks in the building in a corporation so you can't use a real estate residential real estate forum right you can only use a letter of intent you can use your own letter of intent you can make up your own you can do anything you want you then send it to the listing agent and if it's agreed upon then and only then will it go to the attorney to drop the contract You can't draw a contract right OK So so after or I don't know how long Randy's presentation is going to take and then Thursday we'll finish up we'll go over the contracts we'll spend the whole day not the whole day by the time we have on contracts and have your books all ready for you by probably tomorrow for everything and the questions that you the questions that you need to use in order to find out what your buyers needs and wants are so that's one of your jobs you know is to ask all those questions that we had on that page right what page was it And and we'll review them because I have prepared here to each other's book these are this is a it it basically says use answering a client's inquiry on a call control is gained by asking questions goal is an appointment with a contract these are non threatening questions that I've comprised and used through the years and each one of these questions is so non threatening you think why why am I bothering to ask but they lead to other information and other questions so they all lead to something else nobody can say yes or no usually with these questions they lead to information so these are questions that you will practice So I'm going to let you go a little early because I do want everybody who needs to get back to their office get back to their office do what you need to do because I'd like to have I'd love to have Wendy this is going to be a crazy class because we have Thanksgiving coming you know we have another holiday in there somewhere I don't know what it is 0 I think it's election day we won't take off at Election day guys we're not going to take off at Election day but but we do have things going on so I would recommend that you get yourself learn how to do zip forms right away so get yourself everything done You're trying to get your pictures if you can get that done too I can if anybody wants a picture I can take it over Literally comes out good so it's supposed to be a professional photography you did a nice job you I don't know who news but if you want to share that with anybody you used your phone all my cousins took it to me yeah yeah so just get a get somebody take your picture and and get your cards ordered and if your templates are all done perfectly I can have Wendy come next week Good show christies provides the business cards OK yeah we we pay for your business cards we pay for your signs going in and going out for of course yeah after that you're on your own yeah then I remember where when I when I sold my business it ultimately was I was at Caldwell Banker and I had remained there for 3 years contract but I had to pay for everything I had to pay for every time I sign went out and every time it came in I had paid for cards I had to pay for any of my advertising I had to pay you know it's I will have you see when I give you the book on what the company does behind the scenes for you and your listing if you have an open house they're going to be boosting it for you they're going to be you know so we'll talk about boosting we'll talk about you know Sam actually I think I'll have Slava come in early too and go over all the marketing that goes into what you do when you get a listing and what you need to do to create your own brand so the brand that we're working with gives you a step above everybody else believe me I know it it's it's a fact it is a known fact that you know Christy's does give you that edge and so that's one of the things you want to play on when you're brand new with your listing presentation it will be that you you know that you're Christy's you know And so then those are the things we want to work on and we will be working on overcoming doing role playing overcoming objections last class we didn't do too much role play but this class we're going to go back to that so you're welcome to come to role play with this You have your buyers guys and everything OK you you just make that appointment educate your buyer right and let us know tomorrow what happens when does he want to see I'm gonna call him at like 5:30 so let's see let's see so one of the questions you wanna ask him have you been looking where have you been looking what have you you know what are you doing you want something on the waterfront but he's gonna have to add like another 600,000 what he wants or offer him what are some of those old buildings in Fort Lee But yes the horizon my grandparents do salute there perfect you can get something for like 400,000 yeah that's what you're gonna have to show which is great because I'm part of NJMLS technically I'm not part of Hudson County but because our office is like right on the border the manager is great and she's very very very helpful so she's been helping me with that good OK so you can use her access No well it it can it can show some listings I think it can have I mean members of Hudson County can put it in JMLSA lot of them do what they can't do is put it in JMLS and not in Hudson County hudson County is very rigid about wanting their listings in theirs so but yeah that all gets complicated but doesn't mean that you can't show any listing there You know you can show any listing you want you can find them all because they put the every every listing is goes out to Zillow from every MLS so you can find more right now is it accurate no is it updated no so you may find a listing that's already sold but it's still online so OK so you got your homework to do and we will review if Randy finishes a little early we'll start on our contracts and then finish them up on Thursday and then I will see about if you all feel comfortable I can have Wendy come to use it forms because you may need that again I'll let you know when she's coming and I will try to get probably in our 3rd week I'll have Sammy come to do Opcity to see if you're ready to join that did the remind class yes he does both that's the one I want I can really go back because I didn't have access we'll do the whole thing over there We should do the opening number I wanna I wanna do a little thing.

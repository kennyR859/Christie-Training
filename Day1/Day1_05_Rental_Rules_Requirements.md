---

## 3. Criminal Background Check Laws (CRITICAL CHANGES)

### The Law Has Changed
**From Lecture:**
- **OLD LAW**: Agents could get criminal history on tenants immediately during screening
- **NEW LAW**: Cannot request criminal history until AFTER conditional acceptance
- **Process Now**:
  1. Present landlord with lease application showing tenant is qualified (credit, income, etc.)
  2. Landlord provides **conditional acceptance** of the lease
  3. Landlord can then request to conduct criminal history check
  4. Criminal history goes back approximately 5 years
  5. Screening service handles the criminal check (agents don't need to worry about making mistakes)

**Instructor's Warning:**
> "It's getting really complicated"

### New Jersey Fair Chance in Housing Act (FCHA) - 2025 Details

#### Law Background
- **Signed**: June 2021
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2022
- **Still in Effect**: 2025

#### Key Requirements for Landlords & Agents

**1. Conditional Offer Requirement**
- Criminal background checks may NOT be used during initial tenant screening
- Must provide **conditional offer FIRST** before requesting criminal history
- Cannot make any oral or written inquiry into applicant's criminal record before extending conditional offer

**2. Disclosure Requirement**
- Before accepting application fee, landlord must disclose IN WRITING to all applicants:
  - Whether their eligibility criteria includes review of criminal history
  - What specific criminal history will be considered

**3. Two Exceptions (Can Ask Before Conditional Offer)**
Landlords CAN inquire about these before conditional offer:
1. Whether applicant has ever been convicted of drug-related crime for production or manufacture of **methamphetamine** on premises of federally assisted housing
2. Whether applicant is subject to **lifetime registration requirement** on state sex offender registry

#### What Cannot Be Considered
- **Charges without convictions**: Cannot be held against applicants
- **Expunged records**: Cannot be considered in rental decisions
- **Blanket policies**: Cannot have automatic denial policies for any criminal conviction

#### Individualized Assessment Required
- **Case-by-case basis**: Assess each applicant individually
- **Risk evaluation**: Only deny when applicant demonstrates clear risk to:
  - Safety of other residents
  - Safety of the property
- **No automatic disqualifications**: Must consider factors like:
  - Nature and severity of conviction
  - Time elapsed since conviction
  - Evidence of rehabilitation
  - Age at time of offense

#### Exemptions
**The FCHA does NOT apply to:**
- Dwelling units offered for rent in owner-occupied premises of **not more than 4 dwelling units**
- Small landlords living on-site with 4 or fewer units total

### Why This Matters for Agents

**Process Complexity:**
1. Screen tenant for credit, income, rental history FIRST
2. Present qualified tenant to landlord (no criminal history yet)
3. Landlord reviews and provides conditional acceptance
4. Send tenant back to screening service for criminal history (if landlord requests)
5. Landlord reviews criminal history and makes final decision with individualized assessment

**Legal Protection:**
- Screening services like DocuVera handle the criminal check process
- Reduces agent liability for mistakes in screening process
- Ensures compliance with Fair Chance in Housing Act

## 4. Lead Paint Assessment Requirements

### Basic Requirements from Lecture
**From Lecture:**
- Landlords must update lead paint assessments **every two years**
- If tenant moves out after one year, new assessment required before next tenant moves in
- Assessment must be completed after first year if turnover occurs
- "Really important" compliance issue

**Instructor's Note:**
> "That's really important"

### Actual New Jersey Law (2025 Clarification)

#### Timeline Correction
**Important Update**: The lecture mentioned "every two years," but current NJ law (as of 2024 update) requires:
- **Initial inspection**: Within 2 years of July 22, 2022 (deadline was July 22, 2024)
- **Re-inspection cycle**: Every **THREE years**, OR upon tenant turnover, whichever is earlier

#### Lead-Safe Certificate Updates (2024 Change)
- **Previous rule**: Certificates valid for 2 years
- **New rule (September 2024)**: Certificates now valid for **3 years**
- This change aligns certificate validity with the 3-year inspection cycle

#### Applicable Properties
- **Target**: Rental properties built **before 1978**
- **Requirement**: Individual dwelling units must be inspected for lead paint hazards
- Applies to most rental properties in established New Jersey towns

#### Inspection Types (Based on Community Risk)

**Risk Measurement:**
Percentage of children 6 and under with blood lead level ≥ 5 micrograms per deciliter

**Low Risk Communities (< 3% affected):**
- **Method**: Visual inspection acceptable
- Less invasive and less expensive

**High Risk Communities (≥ 3% affected):**
- **Method**: Dust wipe sampling required
- More thorough testing method
- More expensive process

### Property Owner Challenges

**From Lecture - Real-World Issues:**
- Many homeowners/landlords are unaware of these requirements
- Instructor has investment property clients who had no idea about changes
- "I called her to tell her what was going on, they have no idea"

**Municipal Enforcement Gaps:**
- Law was passed with "no vehicle to support the law"
- When instructor went to town building inspectors: "They don't want to hear about it"
- Some towns said: "We don't have somebody that will do that"
- Towns are slowly starting to comply
- Gradually hiring inspectors to handle lead paint assessments

**Agent's Responsibility:**
- Inform clients purchasing investment properties about lead paint requirements
- Ensure landlord clients understand compliance obligations
- Be proactive - don't assume owners know the law

## 5. Lead Pipe Replacement Requirements (Emerging Issue)

### Coming Changes
**From Lecture:**
- "In the future" there will be requirements for residential real estate (both rentals and sales)
- Each town is assessing lead pipes running from town water lines into homes
- Requires removal/replacement of lead service lines
- **Cost**: "Really expensive procedure"

**Assessment Process:**
- Towns will conduct assessments to identify lead pipes
- Town will hire contractors to perform work
- Cost will be passed to homeowners
- Likely assessed through property taxes

**Areas Most Affected:**
- Older, well-established towns (like Palisades Park, etc.)
- Towns with infrastructure built before lead pipe regulations

### New Jersey Lead Service Line Replacement Law (2025 Details)

#### State Mandate
- **Deadline**: All lead service lines must be replaced by **2031**
- **Coverage**: Water systems must identify, notify, and replace ALL lead service lines
- **Expanded Definition**: Galvanized steel pipes now treated like lead under new state law

#### Homeowner Identification Process
**Two Methods:**
1. **Survey approach**: Water systems ask customers to help identify their service line material via survey
2. **Professional inspection**:
   - Contractors perform in-house inspection
   - "Test hole" excavation near water meter or curb stop in front yard
   - Confirms actual pipe material

#### Responsibility and Cost Distribution

**Water System Responsibility:**
- Regardless of who owns the service line, water systems responsible for replacement
- Must create comprehensive replacement plan
- Must ensure all lines replaced by 2031

**Cost Allocation:**
- For investor-owned water systems:
  - Replacement costs (excluding grants/subsidies) borne by ALL customers within the state served by that water system
  - Distributed across entire customer base
  - Not individual homeowner responsibility (for investor-owned systems)

**New Jersey American Water Commitment:**
- Committed to removing all lead service lines by 2031
- Proactive community canvassing to identify lead pipes
- Working with homeowners on replacement scheduling

### Impact on Real Estate Transactions

**For Investment Property Buyers:**
- Need to be aware of potential assessments coming
- May affect property values in older towns
- Could impact cash flow if assessments added to taxes

**For Listing Agents:**
- Disclose known lead pipe information
- Inform sellers about upcoming assessment programs
- Research municipal replacement programs in listing areas

**For Buyer Agents:**
- Research whether town has lead pipe replacement program
- Investigate if assessments already in place
- Factor potential costs into buyer financial planning

## 6. Agent Responsibilities & Client Education

### Proactive Client Communication

**Investment Property Clients:**
From lecture experience:
- "I have many clients in the past that I have sold investment properties to"
- "Made sure I have made them aware of the fact that these changes are in place"
- Many homeowners bought before these laws existed
- **Example**: Sold client a 2-family, then another 2-family, then their personal residence (3 properties total)
- Called to update them on new regulations: "They have no idea"

### Knowledge Gap Reality

**Homeowners Don't Know:**
- Most landlords unaware of criminal check restrictions
- Most landlords unaware of lead paint cycles
- Most landlords unaware of lead pipe assessments coming

**Municipal Knowledge Gap:**
- Building inspectors may not be fully informed
- Some towns actively avoiding enforcement
- "They passed the law with no vehicle to support the law"
- Slowly improving as towns hire compliance staff

**Agent's Competitive Advantage:**
- Being informed about these regulations sets you apart
- Provides real value to investment property clients
- Protects clients from compliance violations
- Builds trust through proactive communication

## Conclusion

Rental property regulations in New Jersey have become significantly more complex, particularly around:
1. **Criminal background check timing and process** (Fair Chance in Housing Act)
2. **Lead paint assessment cycles** (3 years or turnover)
3. **Lead service line replacement** (2031 deadline with costs to homeowners)

**Most important insight from lecture**: Property owners largely don't know about these requirements, municipalities are slowly catching up with enforcement, and agents who proactively educate clients provide exceptional value.

**Action Priority**: Learn your market's specific requirements (lead paint risk levels, lead pipe programs, local enforcement), partner with compliant screening services, and build systems to educate every investment property client about these obligations.

**Competitive Advantage**: While the instructor notes "it's getting really complicated," complexity creates opportunity for knowledgeable professionals who can guide clients through compliance successfully.

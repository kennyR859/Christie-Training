## Overview

## 1. What Was Said in the Lecture

### Brief Mention
**From Lecture:**
> "And there's some of the agents there say oh don't do it it's a waste of time"

**Context:**
- This appears to reference agents' opinions about using UPcity
- Some agents discourage using it, calling it "a waste of time"
- The comment is very brief without elaboration on:
  - What specifically about UPcity is being criticized
  - Whether this is based on cost, lead quality, time investment, or results
  - Which agents said this or what their experience was

**Notable:** The lecture does not provide:
- An explanation of what UPcity is
- How to use UPcity
- Cost considerations
- Success stories or failures
- Recommendation for or against using it

The single sentence suggests there may have been prior discussion about UPcity, or agents are expected to research it independently.

### Why Some Agents Might Call It "A Waste of Time"

**Possible Reasons (Speculation based on common agent frustrations):**

1. **Lead Quality Issues**
   - Lead generation companies found on UPcity may deliver low-quality leads
   - Cost per lead may not justify conversion rates
   - Leads may be shared with multiple agents (not exclusive)

2. **Time Investment**
   - Researching companies and reading reviews takes time
   - Agents may prefer referrals from colleagues
   - Faster to use known providers than research new ones

3. **Cost Considerations**
   - Marketing services on UPcity may be expensive
   - New agents with tight budgets may not see ROI
   - Free or low-cost alternatives might be preferred

4. **Over-Promised Results**
   - Marketing companies may promise more than they deliver
   - Agents may have been burned by services found on UPcity
   - High expectations followed by disappointing results

5. **Not Real Estate Specific**
   - UPcity serves all industries, not just real estate
   - May be harder to find truly real estate-focused providers
   - Reviews from other industries may not translate to real estate effectiveness

6. **Overwhelming Options**
   - Too many choices can lead to decision paralysis
   - Difficult to know which reviews to trust
   - May be easier to stick with established industry providers (Zillow, Realtor.com, etc.)

## 5. Alternative Interpretation: What "UPcity" Might Mean

### Possibility: Different Context?

Given the extremely brief mention and lack of context in the lecture, "UPcity" could potentially refer to:

1. **UpCity Platform** (most likely - what research found)
2. **Different Service**: A regional or company-specific tool with similar name
3. **Misheard/Transcription Error**: Could be a different service entirely
4. **Internal Brokerage Tool**: Some brokerages have proprietary systems

**Recommendation**: Ask the instructor or fellow agents to clarify what specific "UPcity" service/platform was being referenced.

## 8. Making Your Own Decision About UPcity

### Consider Your Situation

**UPcity May Be Useful If:**
- You're researching marketing services and want verified reviews
- You need to hire a web developer, photographer, or marketing agency
- You want to compare multiple service providers before committing
- You value independent reviews and research-based decisions
- You have time to invest in thorough vendor research

**UPcity May NOT Be Worth It If:**
- You need leads immediately, not research about lead providers
- You prefer direct referrals from colleagues you trust
- Your budget doesn't allow for paid marketing services
- You're overwhelmed by choices and need simple recommendations
- Your market has established local providers with proven results

### Alternative Research Methods

**Instead of UPcity, Try:**

1. **Ask Your Broker**
   - What lead generation do they provide?
   - What do they recommend?
   - What have other agents in your office tried?

2. **Agent Mastermind Groups**
   - Facebook groups for agents
   - Local REALTOR® association events
   - Networking with experienced agents
   - Ask agents in non-competing markets what works

3. **Industry Forums and Blogs**
   - BiggerPockets (real estate investors and agents)
   - Active Rain
   - Reddit r/realtors
   - Real estate coaching blogs

4. **Direct Trial**
   - Many services offer money-back guarantees
   - Test small before committing large
   - Track ROI carefully from day one
   - Be willing to pivot if not working

## 9. Critical Thinking About Instructor's Comment

### Analyzing "Don't Do It, It's a Waste of Time"

**What We Don't Know:**
- Which specific aspect of UPcity is a waste of time?
- Was this about using UPcity to find services, or about a specific service found on UPcity?
- What were those agents expecting vs. what they got?
- Did they use it correctly or have unrealistic expectations?
- How long ago did they try it?

**Healthy Skepticism:**
- One person's "waste of time" might be another's valuable resource
- What works varies by market, agent experience level, and budget
- Some agents dismiss tools they didn't use properly
- Services change over time - old reviews may not reflect current quality

**Take All Advice With Context:**
- Successful agents in your market > random opinions
- Data and metrics > emotional reactions
- Your budget and goals > someone else's experience
- Test and measure > assumptions

## 10. Action Items & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

**For Clarification:**
- [ ] Ask the instructor or training coordinator: "What specifically about UPcity should we know?"
- [ ] Clarify if UPcity is required, optional, or discouraged for your brokerage
- [ ] Ask agents who mentioned it's a "waste of time" for specifics

**For Research (Optional):**
- [ ] Visit upcity.com and browse real estate marketing categories
- [ ] Read reviews of 2-3 lead generation companies
- [ ] Compare what you find to recommendations from your broker
- [ ] Determine if any services align with your budget and goals

### Focus Instead On

**Higher Priority Activities for New Agents:**

1. **Master Your CRM** (free, provided by brokerage)
2. **Build SOI List** (free, highest conversion)
3. **Practice Scripts** (free, essential skill)
4. **Learn Circle Prospecting** (low cost, high return)
5. **Attend Training** (free through brokerage)
6. **Shadow Experienced Agents** (free, invaluable)
7. **Practice Contracts** (free, overcome fear)

**Wait on Paid Lead Generation Until:**
- You've exhausted free methods
- You can afford it without financial stress
- You have systems to handle lead volume
- You've proven you can convert free leads first

## 11. Key Takeaways

### Summary Points

1. **UPcity is a Review Platform**: Not a lead generation service itself, but a place to find and review lead generation services

2. **Limited Context in Lecture**: The single sentence warning doesn't provide enough context to make an informed decision

3. **Some Agents Are Skeptical**: But we don't know why or if their experience is relevant to you

4. **Do Your Own Research**: What works varies by agent, market, and resources

5. **Free Methods First**: Exhaust SOI, circle prospecting, and brokerage-provided leads before paying for leads

6. **Focus on Skills**: Lead generation is useless if you can't convert leads - focus on scripts, objection handling, and relationships first

### Most Important Insight

**From Lecture Context:**
The brief, negative mention of UPcity suggests it may not be a priority tool for new agents in this training program. The focus is clearly on relationship-building, objection handling, and foundational skills rather than paid lead generation platforms.

**Recommendation:**
- Don't worry about UPcity right now unless your broker requires it
- Focus on free lead generation methods (SOI, circle prospecting)
- Master objection handling and scripts first
- Revisit paid lead generation after you've proven you can convert free leads

## 12. Conclusion

### The Bottom Line

While UPcity exists as a legitimate review platform for finding service providers (including real estate marketing and lead generation companies), the extremely brief and negative mention in your training suggests:

1. **It's not a priority tool** for your brokerage or training program
2. **Other agents have been disappointed** (though we lack specifics)
3. **Your focus should be elsewhere** - on skills, relationships, and free lead sources

### Best Approach

- **Short term**: Ignore UPcity unless specifically required
- **Focus instead**: SOI, circle prospecting, scripts, objection handling, CRM mastery
- **Long term**: After 6-12 months, if you've exhausted free sources and have budget, research paid lead generation options carefully - UPcity reviews might be helpful then

### Final Thought

The most successful new agents don't start with paid leads. They start by:
1. Building their database (CRM)
2. Contacting their sphere of influence
3. Circle prospecting around listings
4. Mastering objection handling
5. Providing exceptional service that generates referrals

**Lead generation is step 2, not step 1. Conversion is step 1.**

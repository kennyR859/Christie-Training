# Day 1 - Real Estate Agent Training Lecture

## Overview
Welcome to the real estate training program. This lecture covers foundational skills needed for success as a real estate agent, including creating your professional profile, understanding buyer agency agreements, handling objections, and mastering open house procedures.

---

## 1. Professional Profile Development

### Bio and Photo Requirements
- **Professional headshot** required for:
  - Your personalized listing presentation
  - Website profile
  - Business cards
  - Marketing materials

### Value Proposition
Your value proposition represents what you offer to buyers/sellers:
- **Integrity and honesty**
- **Hard work and dedication**
- **Availability to serve clients**
- **Willingness to be uncomfortable** (going the extra mile)
- **Professional service excellence**

**Key Principle:** People buy from agents they like, trust, and feel comfortable with - not just based on market knowledge.

---

## 2. Essential Sales Training Resources

### Dale Carnegie - "How to Win Friends and Influence People"
- Foundation for all quality sales training
- Focus on becoming "magnetic" - people naturally feel good around you
- **Core principle:** Be genuinely interested in others
- **Listen more than you speak**

### Overcoming Fear
Common agent fear: "What if I don't know the answer?"

**Solution Strategy:**
- Use **atTurf** in Platform to download comprehensive town information
- Prepare booklets with:
  - Demographics
  - Population data
  - School locations
  - Shopping centers
  - Average income
  - Town amenities

**Pro Tip:** Every statement during role play must be in the form of a **question** to keep conversations flowing.

---

## 3. Learning and Retention

### Information Absorption Statistics
- **~50% of what is said goes over your head** during first exposure
- **~5% absorption** on Zoom/virtual training
- **~90% retention** when teaching each other

**Best Practice:** Share your work and experiences with fellow agents to maximize learning.

---

## 4. Platform and Technology Setup

### Essential Platform Features
- **atTurf:** Download town information, demographics, amenities
- **Academy:** Take one course per night
- Create customized booklets for each town you show

### Example Preparation
When showing in Ridgewood:
1. Download town demographics
2. Print school information
3. Include shopping centers, coffee shops, bicycle shops
4. Create tabbed folder for client
5. Email or present in person before showing

---

## 5. Communication Strategy

### The Question-Based Approach
**Why Questions Matter:**
- Keeps conversation going
- Builds engagement
- Uncovers client needs
- Establishes trust

**Example:** Instead of stating facts, ask: "What features are most important to you in a neighborhood?"

---

## 6. Testimonials

### Requirements
**All agents need at least 3 testimonials:**

**For New Agents Without Sales:**
- Can use testimonials from previous careers
- References from personal contacts (friends, family)
- Focus on character attributes:
  - Intelligence
  - Generosity with time
  - Caring nature
  - Professionalism

**For Agents with Sales Background:**
- Customer service reviews from dealership work
- Make clear transition: "The level of service I provided at [previous job] is what I bring to real estate"

**Caution:** Be careful about part-time perception - clients want dedicated agents for their biggest investment.

---

## 7. Rental Rules Overview

### Key Changes in Rental Law
- **Criminal history background checks:**
  - Previously allowed upfront
  - Now only AFTER landlord conditionally accepts lease
  - Must use Dr. Varus system
  - Criminal history goes back ~5 years

### Rental Application Process
1. Tenant fills out Dr. Varus application (credit report & history)
2. Agent presents to landlord
3. Landlord conditionally accepts
4. THEN criminal background check can be requested
5. Dr. Varus handles the process (agents don't need to manage)

### Lead Paint Requirements for Rentals
- **Landlord must update lead paint assessments every 2 years**
- If tenant moves out after 1 year, reassessment required
- Upcoming: Towns assessing lead pipes from municipal supply to homes
- Town will likely add assessment costs to property taxes

---

## 8. Residential Sales Requirements

### Homeowner's Property Information Statement
**New Law Requirements:**
- **MANDATORY** for every listing
- Seller must fill out comprehensive disclosure
- **Agent CANNOT assist** in filling it out

**Critical Warnings:**
- Document creates legal liability if incorrect
- If sellers don't remember details: **Write "I don't know"**
- Estate executors who never lived in property: **Write "I have never lived in this home"**
- Children selling parent's home: **Note how long since they lived there**

**Risk:** Incorrect information gives buyers legal recourse to sue AFTER closing.

---

## 9. Buyer's Agreement (Post-NAR Settlement)

### Historical Context
**Department of Justice Settlement:**
- DOJ believed sellers didn't understand they were paying buyer's agent commission
- Settlement removed commission disclosure from MLS listings
- Created mandatory buyer agency agreements

### New Rules
**Buyer's Agent Compensation:**
- No longer advertised in MLS
- Buyer's agent requests compensation in offer
- Can request any percentage (commonly 2.5-3%)
- Seller decides whether to pay

**Strategy for Competitive Offers:**
- If your offer nets seller the most money, they'll typically pay your commission
- **Example:** $100,000 over asking + 3% buyer's agent fee = Seller still accepts if highest net

### Commission Discussion
- Previous system: Listing agent dictated buyer's agent compensation
- **New system: Agents can ask for fair compensation (3%)**
- Higher offers + commission requests often accepted in multiple offer situations

**Quote from instructor:** "You got a raise because people want the highest offer and are willing to pay that agent to bring that buyer to the table."

## 10. Open House Procedures (New Jersey Law)

### Governor's Rules - CRITICAL COMPLIANCE

**What You CAN Do:**
- Show the property only
- Represent the seller only
- Have open house flyers and property information

**What You CANNOT Do:**
- Discuss offers during open house hours
- Sign buyer agency agreements during open house
- Write contracts during open house
- Conduct ANY transaction business

### Compliance Requirements

**Required Signage:**
- Must display disclosure stating you represent the seller
- Document available in Platform for download/printing
- Post prominently (recommended: front door)

**Investigators:**
- 33 new investigators hired for Northern NJ
- They WILL show up at open houses
- They photograph signage and documents
- They test agents with questions

**Penalties for Violations:**
- License suspension
- Fines up to **$15,000**

### After Open House Hours

**If someone wants to make an offer:**

**Option 1:** Close open house, close door to public, write contract
**Option 2:** Make appointment for after open house ends
**Option 3:** Have partner agent meet buyer elsewhere while you continue open house

**For Listing from Your Own Office:**
- If buyer wants to purchase the open house property: **NO buyer agency agreement needed**
- If buyer wants to see OTHER properties: **Buyer agency agreement required**

**Documents to Keep in Hidden Folder:**
- Laptop
- Phone
- Contracts
- All transaction materials

### Open House Sign-In Methods
1. **QR Code** (Platform-generated) - Easiest
2. **Laptop** - Platform open house application
3. **Paper sign-in sheet** - Old fashioned backup

**All methods automatically add to your CRM and send thank you emails.**

## 11. Circle Prospecting (Door Knocking)

### Strategy
When you get a listing, visit neighbors:
- 5 houses on each side
- 10 across the street
- Introduce yourself
- Share listing information

**Key Distinction:**
- **Door knocking** = people who know you (neighborhood, family)
- **Doorbell ringing** = strangers

### Door Knock Script
**Knock 3 times** (sounds more natural than doorbell)

**Have materials in hand:**
- Business card
- Open house flyer
- Listing information

**Stand back** - people are cautious

**Script:**
"Hi, I'm [Your Name] with Christie's International Real Estate. I'm knocking on your door today because I have an open house down the street on Sunday and I wanted to invite the neighbors. I have a flyer here with the listing information."

**Slide under door if preferred - stay calm and relaxed**

### Success Story
- Agent did circle prospecting
- Found 3 siblings preparing parents' home for sale
- Added to CRM prospecting list
- Sent market studies (tracked in Platform)
- 30 days later: All 3 siblings opened the market study
- Called next day - they were ready to list!

**Result:** Got the listing

---

## 12. CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

### Why It's Critical
**Quote from successful agents:**
"I wish I had kept every single contact in one place from day one."

### CRM Benefits
- Stores all contacts permanently
- Automatic follow-up reminders
- Email campaigns
- Tracks engagement
- **Some clients take 5 years to be ready** - CRM keeps them warm

### Best Practices
- Add contacts immediately (not later)
- Don't use napkins, paper plates, envelopes
- Every person you talk to goes in CRM
- Include: dry cleaner, store owners, everyone

**Pro Tip:** Gathering thousands later is impossible. Add them one at a time as you meet people.

---

## 13. Marketing Spheres

### Your Sphere of Influence (Priority #1)
**Definition:** People you already know
- Friends
- Family
- Former colleagues
- Social contacts

**Most sales come from your sphere**

### Circle Marketing (Best for Listings)
- Neighbors of your listings
- Builds local presence
- Lower cost than farming

### Farming (Longer-term Investment)
- Choose specific neighborhood/building
- Consistent marketing required
- More expensive
- Results take time

**Recommendation:** Start with sphere and circle marketing before investing in farm.

---

## 14. Contract of Sale Practice

### Training Approach
**Step 1:** Fill out contract blindly
- No help
- Mark what you don't understand
- Highlight problem areas

**Step 2:** Review together for 2 days (most boring but essential)

**Step 3:** Continue practicing on Zip Forms
- Don't send practice contracts
- Repetition builds confidence

### Common Agent Fear
"Fear of success" - being afraid they won't be able to handle the contract

**Solution:** Practice repeatedly until it becomes second nature.

---

## 15. Accountability and Success

### Accountability Story
**Scenario:** Brand new agent, didn't know what to do

**Manager's requirement:**
- Weekly accountability meetings
- Must have appointments scheduled

**The "Mr. Pope" Story:**
- Agent had no appointments for weekend
- Called long-time prospect "Mr. Pope" just to report an appointment
- Family was in Hamptons - didn't think he'd buy
- **Result: Mr. Pope bought a house that weekend**

**Lesson:** "Accountability works even if your manager feels too busy. INSIST on it."

---

## 16. Objection Handling

### Using ChatGPT for Practice
**Prompt Example:**
"I'm a brand new real estate agent. Can you give me a list of objections and answers to those objections that a seller could make to me during a listing appointment?"

**Practice Method:**
1. Get objection list from ChatGPT
2. Practice responses
3. Role play with other agents
4. Make it conversational

### Dale Carnegie Technique
**Bring people to logical thinking through a series of questions** - not emotional arguments.

**Example Objection:** "I don't want to pay the buyer's broker commission"

**Response (Question-Based):**
"Do you think the 3,000 agents out there with customers for your home will bring their buyers if they're not being compensated? How would we encourage them to show your property?"

"What do you do for a living? Would you go to work every day if you weren't being compensated?"

---

## 17. Lock Boxes and Showings

### Scenario: House Not in Your MLS

**What to do:**
1. Find listing on Zillow
2. Call listing agent
3. Request showing: "I have a customer who'd like to see this property. I don't have access to your lockbox. Can you meet me there or can the homeowner let me in?"

**If they say no:** Ask for alternatives

### Lock Box Story
- Vacant house
- Someone removed key from lock box
- Window was open
- Agent climbed through window
- **Result: Sold the house**

**Lesson:** Problem-solving and determination matter

**Safety tip:** Always ring doorbell even with lockbox access. Check for "Do Not Use Lockbox" signs.

---

## 18. Platform Setup

### Admin Responsibilities
Your admin should:
- Set up Platform templates
- Configure dashboard
- Set up 4 transaction categories:
  1. Listings
  2. Sales
  3. Leases
  4. Rental Listings

### Dashboard Document Requirements
**Admins CANNOT process transactions unless you upload required documents:**
- Contracts
- Addendums
- Disclosures
- All transaction paperwork

**Why:** State law compliance and audit requirements

**Audits happen** - Missing documents = Called in for review

---

## 19. Commission Checks

### Before Payment Review
**Christina Givens or designated compliance officer reviews ALL files:**
- Lead paint disclosure present?
- Seller's disclosure present?
- All required documents uploaded?

**Missing documents = No commission check**

**Lesson:** "Run a clean transaction and you'll be around. Run sloppy transactions and you won't."

---

## 20. Key Reminders

### Professional Attitude
**Customer Service Excellence:**
- Your goal: Help people (commission follows)
- If clients sense you only want commission: They won't work with you
- "People will absolutely sense it"

### Non-Threatening Questions
All questions should:
- Be comfortable to answer
- Lead to more information
- Not feel like interrogation
- Build trust

### Fair Housing Compliance
**Remember:** You cannot discriminate or appear to discriminate
- Be aware of fair housing laws
- Treat all clients equally
- Focus on property features, not neighborhood demographics

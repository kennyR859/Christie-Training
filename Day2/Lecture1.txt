Have had everybody got a pen in theirs from Regency no no no how many missing pets we've got to reach and see pens there that's Regency title and you title company and that's what I got in there Now our course that we're going to go over is in here So so the sense of what what happened here music good health and produce all Thank you for this you're most welcome It was a big hit with my agents because you know we're all under the gun you know like what do we do you know we're back and forth to the car you can close the open house and sit down and let them pull out a paper contract now your office may only be digital every every office is digital In my office I do keep paper hard copy and I keep a folder in the file so that when you go to that open house you have at least one contract of sale packet all right if you don't have that at your office just go to the template and print it out so that you have a hard copy there and you can sit down after that open house and write it up write it out because you can always scan and upload these documents that's not a problem So it just just make sure that you have what you need for that open house all right i'm going to start with a little bit you don't know the history of it I don't know whether you agree with the history of this It was we we actually brought this on ourselves the lawsuit OK and it was done by our Board of Directors in the NAR fire Agency has been around for at least as far as I know it started in commercial commercials always been by our agency the buyer agents contracts with their clients that a client pays the fee It hasn't been done so much in residential until they are made so they started in Colorado and then California and then Hawaii the West Coast started firstly the practice we do we did have sporadic practice on these not really We use what they call sub agency which meant everybody worked for the seller well now that we are really forced to all be by our agents it it just makes sense that some agency is dead because you look at it and the buyer gave their information to the agent and the agent was the sub agent of the the seller so they had to tell the seller all the buyers information that really should have been done and cut off years ago but we didn't do it but it worked well I built a career on it can I tell you now we split the two all right the lawsuit came about because of antitrust the Department of Justice watches businesses constantly to see if there's any price fixing or collusion and any of that stuff we the National Association of Realtors put in a policy called clear cooperation and that means if you remember the MLS got to participate put your stuff in because there were people who were participating in the LLS but withholding their stuff they're using everybody else's and keeping those private and that caused a big big fight in Las Vegas who brought it to the floor and you know it was just a big deal and it's it's not right you're working for the seller you need to put that listing out there to the broadest audience you possibly can to get the best offer for your client it may not be the highest sometimes the best is just all cash that is 20,000 less and that's what the people need or the more important particularly in our area here is tiny i've got a promotion I got to be from here to here and the timing is more important 6 months closing even if it's higher it doesn't work for me that type of thing so you're looking for your best contract you may not find it if you hide the listing and put it only in your client so that made sense so everybody has to report their listing in the MOS within 24 hours there are three ways to do it one is hold it office exclusive and stage it and clean it up and then release it and not show it the other was non dissemination all right we got a few things we got to do but we're willing to cooperate until we go open go public over the weekend or something like that so you do the non dissemination people house the 3rd is a delayed showing and the delayed showing is a sales technique but they allow us to do it and that means I put the listing on today but we're not showing it until the open house so there are three things that came out of color cooperation which was fine it really cleaned up our our cleared our heads on a lot of our practice and and put it in perspective the bad thing was that board of directors said well they've got to pay us too No they don't And the Department of Justice jumped on it and big losses multi $1,000,000 attorneys it's just it just became a big mess because the board of directors made one stupid mistake and that was our own National Association that did it so they pushed it all off on the MLS therefore clear cooperation that cleans it up by the MOS show compensation for our buyers agent So no no commissions can even be shown in the listing. When you go into the MLS it's just information it is a vehicle to disseminate that information and share it so that your seller gets full coverage all right and also when you go into the MLS if your brokers broker has set it up which you always have it puts it out to it it syndicates it to a lot of different websites And this one company called Miss Hub and List Hub has gosh I don't know 500 a 1000 different sites now you think of how many newspapers we got they're part of his list of so it just makes sense to syndicate your property out there because you don't know somebody from Chicago might be coming in and say 0 smoke look at this this looks good let's go see it that type of thing so putting your listing in the MOS is the right thing to do II feel for the client So with that being said we got the settlement which says you're not going to show it and it's going to be separated and you will have to have a contract with your buyer all right fine the state of New Jersey said we are the governor of the state of New Jersey said I want to put my spin on this thing because we were in Senate October within AR he said no I want it done by August Well here we were like in June May June I mean everybody's scrambling but we didn't anyhow what came out of that is the first page And the first page is 5 things here that came out of that legislation and quite frankly they're good another way of cleaning up our industry and protecting us as well First off it requires a fully completed seller property disclosure for you probably I don't know how many have seen that form yet they haven't seen it yet they haven't seen it yet all right property disclosure is documents we go through the roof was replaced five years ago you know all of that stuff now that's going to be updated again as far as the systems are concerned you will have to put that in with your listing at the time you make it live and make it public The other thing is that when you will have to make put it in when your listing goes live it needs to be there by law the lead pay has to be there and it has to be there within 24 hours all right people realize that you signed the document and you don't get all the papers particularly the sellers disclosure they they may take 24 48 hours to try to fill that thing out and get it in Sensor that they may have to apply so but you do have a little leeway a.... you that's not the case this morning


Always with us the money and then he wanted they sell their house they want to go there and they come back I do I do suggest you join New Jersey MLS when you get a chance We've been trying to get the two combined for a number of years and we thought while we were on top of it an event happened and it didn't happen It will eventually I believe but right now you got to watch out for your rearing You got to watch with all however we got a little more leeway with our New Jersey MLS garden State is tough too garden State will give you 48 hours and then those after you but they have a little bit more leeway than Hudson hudson Davis 24 so you have that that was a good win because




For the ever since the mid 80s but you could use it or not use it and some people some agents said oh this would mean you don't have to do it so it wasn't a level playing field now it is everybody has to do it including a for Sale by own they would they were getting away with murder you know not anymore explain that a little bit more to everybody because I don't even think they've heard of that yet for Sale by owner We just started yesterday well in in this oh OK in the state of New Jersey you have the right to put an ad out and and sell your house yourself you know privately if you do we got to follow the laws it's like everybody else now which was a good thing people are not really doing much for Sale by owner now why we give them more money it's real simple it always boils down to money doesn't it I'll explain why we get them there's a real there's real logic to why we get them yeah and that you will you will learn that as you go through here And there's techniques and we had to learn them as many as we could to get that to have the story richard Sellers disclosure number two ensures the listing agents disclose who they represent at an open house through signage now in your pocket where is this very important oh the the document that says I believe they have it in there Oh you have it OK great Everybody has it you don't have it in the package I'll get you one I think they actually have it in here Probably do but I'll go keep it out there's already on the file setup OK That's a very important document I want to tell you about the documents and what's going on with the governor coming out and negotiating with it by the way the New Jersey association with really went to that So they work with the governor's office to make sure it came out in the gap on that side so I as soon as I said I called him up and I thanked him I noticed the last two years and they were really just Commission jail secretary is charged with enforcing this so they hired 33 more investigators for our area here in North Jersey to check us out and make sure we're doing what we're supposed to do all right the first thing is you have to display this disclosure because we're not fire walks into that i'm playing down the right and the offices will provide you with this for your open house you have this you have this you can just go right into Staples get one you can go right into the dashboard our platform and pull it down this platform I'm sorry go into platform called down and credit yourself and put it back but this has to be displayed primarily now I have a really great agent who was on and open house holding that open house and she's very diligent everybody and they came and the first thing they did was they took their phone camera and she had it right on the front door and they would click and they took the pictures they're doing a dossier on this open house that she's wearing they went around to see the documents that she had she had all the property documents she had the survey she had a SOAS disclosure she had a copy of the listing the things that the seller you need to do for the seller Again the governor thinks that when people walk through the open house that we're we're going to pounce on them and tie their hands behind their back and make them sign And that's the thinking and the legislature are great so we know where we stand with them right So that was the reason he really did this he said you're there only for the sellers you're to push the seller's house if somebody wants to buy the house you can do that's fine Say listen I appreciate that I love I will do the contract for you after as soon as the open house is over therefore we've got the contract here close the front door sit down and write the contractors 4O1 you can write OK the open house is over so that I just ask for the open house there are some hours right yes it's starting from one and 2 We are not allowed to finish that you don't have more people to finish it You you established the hours the hours will cover you on a contract time you close the door and you're right figure half hour after the open house people are like they're going to other open houses and they get delayed and whatever you do I agree with you you end up there so you may want to make the appointment for 4:36 We'll be closing down the open house we still have a few people in the car I was happy to meet you at 4:30 and do the contract and you can and you can do it all right that's a very good point because there's always strikers I mean that's just life and the way it is first thing was they took a picture of this they took a picture of her documents they asked her questions and she's savvy she knows it we said we did this i've done this training now I don't know 1520 times at least six times before during that initial stage just to make sure all of us were thinking because what we had to do is what you have to do we had to unthink undo and redo and rethink because we have 25 30 forty years in the business and now all of a sudden we got to change right so that's why the process was so they ask you the questions you know wow we we like the house we'd like to make it offers I'll be glad to talk to you about that as soon as the open house is over and I close it down and and we'll sit down she answered every question perfectly finish the dots the report sent it into the real estate Commission approved That's what's happening in our world alright this is a very vital vital document and you will see other brokers doing wrong things I think that's probably one of the best things Fern and I could tell you right at this moment there are people in our business that don't know what you're going to know they haven't learned it if they've learned it some of them don't want to do it Some of them skirt it if they can some of them are disorganized we just don't go there all right you're going to see bad things you copy the winners the people who are doing it right always stick with the winners they will do the things right they will show you the right rocks to cross the river so you don't drop it in doubt and drought you know that type of thing so just be worried cautious again like yesterday II think I said just do it right the first time then you don't have to go back and redo it or answer to somebody because you didn't do it right just do it you know it's a lot easier I can tell you less headaches all right all right so we're doing this that's number two allow for designated agency now there are different forms of agency we talked about the sub agency which we're about all right we have the buyer agency we have the seller agency you represent the seller or you represent the buyer what is designated designated we have two types of representations when we do a contract you can do a dual agent which means I'm the agent for both parties That's a double edged sword because what they do is they say and she says but I'm the buyer and you're working for the seller I don't want you to buy negotiate because you got to tell every the seller everything that's part of agency so you you have to share everything that you know with that seller not everything well most only things of substance substance yeah I think that's most everything well I mean you you can't tell that they're getting a divorce or you can't tell that they just inherited $2 million and they could pay anything they want for the house Yeah you know yeah there is a confidentiality you're absolutely correct but if they volunteer it you're obligated to tell your client and bring it back to your client so I'm as you said this ain't hard work for me OK II want my my own agent So what you can do is designate an agent to do the negotiation actually I've told my agents you can take the initial offer and write it up Just tell them I am here on behalf of the seller don't give me all your information that you would give to AAA buyer agent Give me the necessary information I need to write the contract for you I need your pre approval and I can take that into the seller for you or I can give you a designated or I can designate another agent now and have them do all that therefore they have an option you know and you have the option to work in a dual agency for do the designated agency i've told most of my agents but I told all my agents designated agencies probably the best it takes that listing agent off the hook You're there and what happens as soon as you do a dual agent you're doing more for him than you're doing for me Who do you really represent them or me Don't go there you know it's a headache that you don't need don't create problems for yourself all right it's just if you can avoid a problem avoid it and and do it a different way designated agency was being done by us contression we've been doing it for 40 years We just wasn't it wasn't in the law so now we've got it put into the law that what we're doing is legal all right and really in our company is if it's a listing for Christie's we're all dual agents the whole company all 1000 of us whether you know the agent whether the office where it is or the sellers you are diligent because it is the company's listing that automatically makes us a dual agent Can you do the sale yourself if you know none of those things you probably could all right but what I do is I have them call me I have the agents call me and let me oversee it so that I I'm your backup I'm your cover you know somebody comes after you they got to talk to me all right and I can probably handle it OK plus we have an in house attorney that could help us if we need it all right Requires brokerage service agreements agency agreements now we have one here in this practice of and senior in your book too well actually it's in it's in their books but it is in the contract with the contract yes Well in your in your templates your advent will set up the templates transactions so it should be there if it's not you can just you can go into the Christies library and there are different libraries in New Jersey MLS library with their forms there's New Jersey Realtors library with a lot of different forms you don't want to use theirs it's about six or 8 pages long II have an ancient new one this week and I said how did you go to this it's a contract you know ours is a contract as well but it's boiled down to really basics and understandable Number one who do you represent who's the client number two does the buyer have a relationship with another broker yes or no do they have a signed agreement with another broker you need to know that because that that could cause them to pay a fee to two different programs so you ask it what do you do at that point if they do they need to either terminate that contract it is very easy with the other buyer agent according to the the state all we have to do is send an email to the other agent I'm terminating our contract and then they can work with you all right If you I want to digress a moment on that open house if there is somebody wants to buy it you do not have to do the buyer agency agreement because you're representing that seller and you and the seller directs you to do all that business with them on that day alright so you would stop and do the contract or have somebody else designated agent do the contract after the open house after the open house all right so you would not have to sign it in that respect however if they said well there was two other houses we saw an open house can you take us out there and one of the people leave to show them those houses they would have to do it for the other houses all right you'd only do that for the house you want OK declaration of the business relationship all right your licensee and the broker very easy and you should check that second box and that says buyer agent doesn't need agent the school disclose dual agent if the opportunity arises that gives you every option to show every house if they said fire agent only could you really show our listings No because that would be dual edges right You you you talk talk some of them through this they'll say well I don't I don't want you to survive racer I want to say wait a minute that restricts us to what we could show you and if if it's ours we can't show it to you if someone does not offer compensation we cannot show it to you we we've got a problem all right and you're you're limiting yourself we leave it open you and I can always discuss it and we could change our minds and business as we move along because this business is flexible and fluid none of your transactions will be identical to another they will be close but there's always little different things that happen OK the term you have to put a start date and end date for those of you who will be doing 3rd party which is the city and zero or a referral from an outside agent or somebody from Chrissy's or whatever it should you should always have a written document that a referral agreement number one Let's see you should always I lost my tree I thought I died birds I do it too don't worry about it yeah it does it happens the other you get the more it happens when you have a referral that it always has to be right it should be right 0 for 3rd party 3rd parties this is people coming from out of the area They don't know the area they don't know you they they they're like sort of a captive audience and they're they're worried about this so I'll notice that my agents will do a one week listing buyer agency agreement and they say listen let's just do this for one week we'll work together for the week you're here you're coming in to look for houses let's work together for this week we can always extend it all right to a full transaction that's not a problem and most people will say OK and they say well what if it doesn't work out today well we can terminate the agreement it's that easy you just say I'm giving written notice to terminating it it's not all right and sometimes it doesn't work sometimes it doesn't work for the agent either you know it just sometimes just doesn't click so you may may not work out but that gives you the opportunity to get that lead and to work with that lead and just establish that relationship because there's no relationship and they're they're they're looking at this and saying what are we getting into You give them a little ego and I always remind them that you can show them because we talked about this all the time Randy people from New York or wherever they don't understand they think they have to go to 10 different brokers because they don't have a good MLS always remind them that you can show them everything in the state of New Jersey True it's so important and that's why you check box number two so how long should we make the term for my I have to tell you what my agents are doing they're making it for the same term as as the listing and we take 6 month listings That doesn't always happen three months one day one 1 day 11 house one house one house they can say listen we want to see this one house with you and you say fine I'll send you you know we'll bring the buyer agency agreement and make it one house We may make it for 30 days so that we're covered but we're still covered because if we have the agreement and we follow up the showing we know they know that's us that who are the current cause and for referrals do we also fill one of these out yes that because the referral company doesn't do anything with send them through So you'll need to do the work on your end my my suggestion to my agents and to you is when you get a referral you know like absolutely Oh yeah we pre approved and we've done this and that that I just disregard it I don't think they do a thorough job I think they do a quick and dirty and send it out in the system all right and that's my opinion that I know I'm right because I see what my agents have gone through but what we're talking about I think is let's say that you have a friend who's going to buy in New York and you refer to another agent does she need to fill that out or with the receiving agent fill it out no the receiving agent would because they're going to actually be working with the buyer the person who works with the buyer it's going to fill out the form OK you wouldn't have to but you should fill out a referral agreement one that's legal that what one that's agreed to both brokers will sign off on it I sign off for my agent the other broker signs off for theirs property closes they owe us the money or we owe them the money whichever way it was so always have that agreement even in company Our our commissions department now is looking for it they will not process a referral fee unless you have the form and we've had to go back agents go back and say we've been friends for years we've been doing this for years we never had a form is required for commissions now we need to do it OK I just said and you could do it forever One form this is our agreement this is our they share their business for years never over for open you know it's just it's just sort of crazy but nevertheless it is a guide to Commission's to make sure it's correct because it's terrible to pay the Commission and then have to say you got to give it back 'cause I got to give them a piece you know what I mean creates havoc in in internally and my dad used to say you know there's an old saying farm saying that fences make good friends and so you never know because we have had situations where people had it without in writing and then I don't want to play King Solomon neither does Randy we don't want to cut anybody you know we need to have it in writing yeah we have to have it in writing I'll tell you the scenario that happened to me that another company some years back and I had two agents and they made the agreement and it was signed and they went out and one did nothing and the other one did it all OK because she something rose that she couldn't do anything Jesus had to have the other party do it and he came and said she came the one party said I did all the work I don't want to pay the contract you got to pay you know I said that's why we have the contract you know is to set it up it's been agreed to it's too late all right so those things can happen unfortunately if the other party had have been a little bit more fairly would have said less than you're right forget it you know but they weren't they wanted the money OK all right down here it's very strange friends you have to be very careful And sometimes the relationship changes you always should have a buddy someone to back you up you know 'cause you look at a broker and the broker is back here for every single one of you now in my office at 65 agents that if we did an hour an hour and I do 8 you get 8 minutes a day that's not the way we work You and you for instance and Cynthia would make good buddies right that would be good As soon as I went on vacation somebody wanted to buy a house what do I do now go to the listing broker absolutely not my buddy I call my buddy to listen to ready to write to contract they write the contract and put it together for me and I pay them a referral fee you know to do it I didn't want to lose the business always have a backup buddy and someone that you feel comfortable with I picked someone who would treat my clients like I would treat them and that's how I picked my buddy OK next II know I'm going along pretty quick any questions at this at this junction no we're OK next Commission compensation to buyer's agent you are setting your paycheck don't set it low if you want to set it at a fair rate all right you're going out even though your brand new in the business and you may take another broker or another agent with you you may have a mentor in in your office I don't know whether you will or not but if you do have a mentor that's fine you take them along and that gives you a little more credibility and that helps you get get the full fee my thoughts are we're fully trained we have been we've have a backup we have a broker and I just had one the agent went in and she got the 4 feet I went with her and I just sat there and she did a wonderful presentation she was new to our area and she got the listing and I just and the guy looked at me 11 of us doing when she was making a presentation I said she's absolutely right she's absolutely right and he said OK and I'll sign I mean it's dumb stuff but that's what the public needs you know so you you will ask IH has asked for 3% now we don't call up and ask what the fee is unless the client says how I want to find out how much the seller is you know going to compensate me USC agent and then we'll take it from there I call my agents just put in 3% that covers the whole thing generally for us and if you are in a multiple office situation not even in a multiple office situation if you have the highest net to that seller they will pay you to get that that contract they want that buyer and they're willing to pay that agent to bring that buyer to the table and close that contract So we did this and what I what I presented it to the group I said you you can now get a raise because what was happening was the listing agent was taking the listing and giving us what they wanted to give us all right and that was low and I said that's not acceptable anymore we're going to raise the bar we're going to make a better living and we're going to ask for 3% and they Oh my God they rolled their eyes and so forth about half of them came back and they got it It was like see I told you you know I didn't say that but you know they were they were believers because they had the best offer that seller wanted the most money in their pocket and they're willing to pay that agent the full fee that that agent has asked for to bring that contract to fruition all right so you're paying yourself and i've seen some people under pay themselves and I.


make the seller happy as the buyer's agent, as long as seller is happy with the offer. seller will pay higher compensaton to buyer's agents.

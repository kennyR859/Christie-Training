# Circle Prospecting Mastery
## The 86% Rule and Neighborhood Domination Strategy

**Critical Statistic:** 86% of people list with the FIRST person they speak to (NAR)
**Market Pattern:** When 1 house sells, 3 others in the neighborhood list within 12-18 months
**Opportunity:** Major teams and competitors DON'T do this consistently

---

## Why Circle Prospecting Works

### The Statistics

**NAR Finding:**
> "86% of people list with the first person they speak to"

**Implication:** You MUST be FIRST to contact potential sellers.

**Market Pattern:**
> "Whenever one house sells in a neighborhood within a year to a year and 1/2, 3 other homes will come on the market"

**Why:** Neighbors get the idea, see comparable sales, understand market timing.

### The Competitive Advantage

**From the Lecture:**
> "Don't think you're going to have competition. I know major teams that call me and say I don't understand it I got this great listing and then some of the neighbors listed with somebody else and I said well team circle marketing? No they're not."

**Key Point:**
- Major teams and top producers often DON'T circle prospect
- They rely on social media and existing reputation
- **This creates a MASSIVE opportunity window for YOU**
- You're waking up business they could have had

---

## What Is Circle Prospecting?

### The Basic Formula

**Standard Circle:**
- 5 houses on one side of listing
- 5 houses on other side of listing
- 10 houses across the street
- **Total: 20 doors**

**Variations:**
- Can adjust based on street layout
- Cul-de-sacs: entire circle
- Busy streets: same side only for safety
- Apartment buildings: entire floor or building

### When to Circle Prospect

✅ **New Listing Taken**
- "Hi, I just listed your neighbor's home at [address]"
- Share listing information
- Introduce yourself as local specialist

✅ **Open House (Day Before or Day Of)**
- "I'm holding an open house Sunday at [address]"
- Invite neighbors personally
- Creates attendance and buzz

✅ **Property SOLD**
- "Your neighbor's home just sold at [address]"
- Share sale price if public
- "Do you know anyone thinking of moving?"

## Door Knocking vs. Doorbell Ringing

### Critical Distinction

**Door Knocking:**
- People you know or are familiar with in neighborhood
- Family, friends approach
- Less threatening
- More welcoming response

**Doorbell Ringing:**
- Strangers approach
- Sales pitch implication
- Creates anxiety
- Higher rejection rate

**From the Lecture:**
> "He said First off it's door knocking not doorbell ringing. Doorbell ringing is strangers. Door knocking is people generally in the neighborhood are people your family who know you they don't ring a doorbell they're familiar with you."

### Why This Matters Psychologically

**Doorbell = Stranger**
- Formal, distant
- Prepared sales pitch expected
- Guards go up
- Quick rejection likely

**Knock = Neighbor/Friend**
- Casual, familiar
- Neighborly conversation
- More open reception
- Listen to what you have to say

## The Perfect Door Knock Technique

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Preparation**
- Have flyer/card in hand BEFORE approaching
- Visible but not aggressive
- Professional appearance
- Confident posture

**Step 2: The Approach**
- Walk to door normally (don't rush, don't hesitate)
- **Three knocks** (firm but not aggressive)
- "Not three times on the ceiling" (old song reference)
- Three sounds more real, not "thump thump" harsh

**Step 3: Turn Away (Critical!)**
> "You knock three times...turn away"

**Why Turn Away:**
- Less threatening
- Gives them moment to see who it is
- You're not staring at door waiting
- Reduces pressure feeling
- People in area are "really afraid" - this helps

**Step 4: The Storm Door Dynamic**
> "People in this area are really afraid. First off they answer the door so you probably have a storm door that's locked you know there and when they open the door..."

**What Happens:**
- They open main door
- Storm door stays locked (safety)
- You're turned slightly away
- They feel in control

**Step 5: Show Your Material**
> "You have it in your hand. Slowly that don't go like this 'cause... you know they're frightened to death"

**The Approach:**
- Card/flyer already visible
- Slow, deliberate movements
- Non-threatening presentation
- Can slide under door if they prefer

## The Perfect Script

### Opening Line

**Template:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name] with Christie's International Real Estate. The reason I'm knocking on your door today is [reason]."

### Three Variations

**Variation 1: New Listing**
"Hi, I'm [Name] with Christie's International Real Estate. The reason I'm knocking on your door today is I just listed your neighbor's home at [address]. I wanted to introduce myself and share information about the property. Here's a flyer with all the details."

**Variation 2: Open House**
"Hi, I'm [Name] with Christie's International Real Estate. The reason I'm knocking on your door today is I have an open house down the street on Sunday at [address] and we're inviting the neighbors. I have a copy of the listing here. [Slide under door if needed]"

**Variation 3: Just Sold**
"Hi, I'm [Name] with Christie's International Real Estate. The reason I'm knocking on your door today is your neighbor's home at [address] just sold. I wanted to introduce myself as a local real estate specialist. Do you know anyone in the area thinking of moving?"

### Key Elements

**Calm and Relaxed:**
> "Make sure you relax and you do it very easily. Put them at ease."

**Not Rushing:**
> "You're calm you're relaxed you're not rushing no no"

**Get Information Across:**
- Your name
- Your company
- Reason for visit
- Physical material (flyer/card)

**Handle the Talkers:**
> "You'll get the talky ones you know"

Be polite but don't get trapped in hour-long conversations.

### Why "Moving" Not "Selling" or "Buying"

**From the Lecture:**
> "Do you know anybody else who might be thinking of moving? We have loads of customers for your great neighborhood. And that's the words the right words: moving not selling not buying because they don't know where they're going to sell or buy but they're talking about moving."

**Psychology:**
- **"Selling"** = transaction focus, may not be ready
- **"Buying"** = assumes they know next step
- **"Moving"** = life change concept, more open-ended

**Perfect Question:**
"Do you know anyone in the neighborhood thinking of moving?"

**Why It Works:**

- Covers both selling and buying in one word
- Reflects how people actually think

**Initial Reaction = Everyone's Reaction**
It feels uncomfortable at first. But results create enthusiasm.

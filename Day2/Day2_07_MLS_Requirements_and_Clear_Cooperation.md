# MLS Requirements and Clear Cooperation Policy
## Understanding Listing Submission Rules and Syndication

**NAR Policy:** Clear Cooperation Policy
**Timeline:** Within one business day (24 hours) of public marketing
**Purpose:** Ensure broadest exposure for seller clients
**Compliance:** Mandatory for all MLS participants

---

## Executive Summary

The Clear Cooperation Policy requires agents to submit listings to the MLS within one business day of any public marketing. This ensures sellers receive maximum market exposure and prevents agents from "pocket listing" properties while using MLS resources. Understanding these requirements is essential for compliance and providing excellent seller service.

**Key Principle:** Working for the seller means putting the listing out to the broadest audience possible to get the best offer.

---

## Historical Context: Why Clear Cooperation Exists

### The Problem

**From the Lecture:**
> "There were people who were participating in the LLS but withholding their stuff. They're using everybody else's and keeping those private and that caused a big big fight in Las Vegas who brought it to the floor."

**The Unfair Practice:**
- Agents participated in MLS (used others' listings)
- But withheld their own listings (kept them private/office exclusive)
- Used MLS resources without contributing back
- Gave their own buyers unfair advantage
- Reduced market exposure for their sellers

**Why This Was Wrong:**
> "It's not right. You're working for the seller. You need to put that listing out there to the broadest audience you possibly can to get the best offer for your client."

### The Fight for Change

**Las Vegas Controversy:**
- Local agents brought issue to NAR floor
- Major debate over MLS participation requirements
- "Big big fight" over pocket listings
- Eventually led to Clear Cooperation Policy

**Ethical Foundation:**
When you represent a seller, your duty is to provide **maximum market exposure** to obtain the **best possible offer** - not to keep listings private for your own benefit.

## Clear Cooperation Policy Requirements

### The 24-Hour / One Business Day Rule

**Official Requirement:**
> "Within one business day of marketing a property to the public, the listing broker must submit the listing to the MLS for cooperation with other MLS participants."

**Key Terms:**
- **One Business Day:** Changed from original "24 hours" to accommodate weekends/holidays
- **Business Days:** Excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays
- **Public Marketing:** Any marketing to general public (see definition below)
- **Submit to MLS:** Enter all required listing data and make searchable to MLS participants

**Example Timeline:**

**Scenario 1: Weekday Launch**
- Monday 10:00 AM: Put yard sign up (public marketing begins)
- Tuesday 5:00 PM: Must be in MLS by end of Tuesday (one business day)

**Scenario 2: Weekend Launch**
- Saturday 10:00 AM: Open house with sign (public marketing begins)
- Monday 5:00 PM: Must be in MLS by end of Monday (one business day, excluding Sunday)

**Scenario 3: Holiday Weekend**
- Friday before Labor Day: Post on Facebook (public marketing begins)
- Tuesday after holiday: Must be in MLS by end of Tuesday (one business day, excluding Saturday, Sunday, Monday holiday)

### What Constitutes "Public Marketing"

**From NAR Policy:**
Public marketing includes, but is not limited to:
- ✅ **Yard signs** displayed on property
- ✅ **Flyers** in windows or available to public
- ✅ **Digital marketing** on public websites
- ✅ **Brokerage website displays** (including IDX and VOW)
- ✅ **Social media marketing** (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- ✅ **Email blasts** to distribution lists
- ✅ **Digital advertisements** (online ads, banner ads)
- ✅ **Multi-brokerage listing sharing networks**
- ✅ **Mobile applications** available to general public
- ✅ **Print advertising** (newspapers, magazines)
- ✅ **Direct mail campaigns** to public
- ✅ **Open houses** (advertised to public)

**Specifically:**
If the general public can see it, it's public marketing.

### What Is NOT Considered "Public Marketing"

**Permitted Without MLS Submission:**
- ❌ **Private communications** to known buyers/agents
- ❌ **Internal office discussions** among brokerage staff
- ❌ **Coming soon notifications** to internal database only
- ❌ **Staging/photography preparation** without public advertising
- ❌ **Discussions with potential buyers** from agent's personal network
- ❌ **Office exclusive listings** (with proper seller written consent)

**Key Distinction:**
Marketing to select individuals you personally know vs. marketing to the general public.

## The Three Listing Options Under Clear Cooperation

### Option 1: Office Exclusive Listing

**From the Lecture:**
> "One is hold it office exclusive and stage it and clean it up and then release it and not show it."

**How It Works:**
- Listing taken but not marketed publicly
- Property being staged, cleaned, prepared
- Agent works within their own office/client base
- **No public marketing** during this period
- File with MLS as "Office Exclusive" status
- **Not disseminated to other MLS participants**

**Purpose:**
- Allow time for property preparation
- Stage professionally before photos
- Complete repairs or improvements
- Present property at its best

**Seller Requirements:**
> "Where the seller has directed the listing broker to not publicly market their property and to not disseminate it through the MLS to other MLS Participants and Subscribers, the Participant may then take the listing as an office exclusive exempt listing and such listing shall be filed with the MLS, subject to its local filing rules, but not disseminated to other MLS Participants and Subscribers."

**Key Point:**
- **Seller must direct** this in writing
- Cannot be agent's unilateral decision
- Seller must understand trade-offs
- Document seller's informed consent

**When Office Exclusive Ends:**
As soon as property is publicly marketed (sign, social media, etc.), must submit to MLS within one business day.

**Important Limitation:**
> "However, if office exclusive listings are displayed or advertised to the general public, those listings must also be submitted to the MLS for cooperation."

Cannot claim "office exclusive" while publicly marketing.

### Option 2: Non-Dissemination Status

**From the Lecture:**
> "The other was non dissemination all right we got a few things we got to do but we're willing to cooperate until we go open go public over the weekend or something like that so you do the non dissemination."

**How It Works:**
- Listing filed with MLS
- Shows as "non-dissemination" status
- **Not yet displayed publicly** on MLS
- Gives time for final preparations
- Short-term status (typically 24-48 hours)

**Purpose:**
- Final preparations before full public launch
- Weekend staging before Monday launch
- Last-minute details to complete
- Coordination with seller's timing

**Cooperation:**
> "We got a few things we got to do but we're willing to cooperate until we go open go public over the weekend or something like that."

- Indicates cooperation is coming
- Transparent with MLS about timing
- Maintains compliance during prep

**Typical Usage:**
- Thursday: List as non-dissemination
- Friday-Saturday: Final staging and photography
- Sunday: Open house
- Monday: Full MLS public launch

### Option 3: Delayed Showing

**From the Lecture:**
> "The 3rd is a delayed showing and the delayed showing is a sales technique but they allow us to do it and that means I put the listing on today but we're not showing it until the open house."

**How It Works:**
- Listing goes into MLS **immediately and fully**
- Publicly marketed and visible to all participants
- **BUT: Showings delayed until specific date/time**
- Usually until open house or specific date

**Purpose:**
- **Sales technique** to create urgency and buzz
- Drive traffic to open house
- Create anticipation and competition
- Maximize attendance at initial showing

**Example:**
- Monday: List property in MLS with photos, description, price
- Notation: "Showings begin at open house Sunday 1-4 PM"
- Monday-Saturday: No individual showings
- Sunday: Open house with multiple interested parties
- Sunday onward: Individual showings permitted

**Marketing Advantage:**
- Creates event around open house
- Multiple buyers see property simultaneously
- Increases perceived demand
- Can generate multiple offers at once

**Seller Benefit:**
- Full MLS exposure from day one
- Strategic showing timing
- Potential for competitive offers
- Professional presentation

**NAR Clarification:**
> "The delayed showing is a sales technique but they allow us to do it."

Clear Cooperation allows this because listing IS in MLS immediately, just with delayed showing access.

### NEW (2025): Delayed Marketing Exempt Listings

**Recent NAR Addition:**
NAR introduced new category working alongside Clear Cooperation.

**How It Works:**
- Listed in MLS and available to MLS participants
- Other agents can access and share with their clients
- **BUT: Delayed from IDX feeds and syndication**
- No immediate public website display
- MLS participants can still see it

**Requirements:**
- Seller must sign **written disclosure**
- Acknowledges waiving benefits of immediate public marketing
- Understands delayed IDX and syndication
- Informed consent to limited marketing period

**Purpose:**
- Gives sellers option to test market privately through agents first
- Maintains MLS participation
- Allows strategic phased launch
- Professional only first, then public

**Timeline:**
- Effective May 2025 for major platforms

**Important Note:**
> "Starting May 2025, any listing that has been publicly marketed but not added to the MLS within 24 hours will not be published on Zillow—or its subsidiary, Trulia—for the life of the listing."

Non-compliance has significant consequences.

## Finding the Best Offer for Your Seller

### It's Not Always About Highest Price

**From the Lecture:**
> "You're looking for your best contract. It may not be the highest. Sometimes the best is just all cash that is 20,000 less and that's what the people need."

**Factors in "Best Offer":**

**1. Price**
- Highest offer is just one consideration
- May not be best overall value

**2. Financing Terms**
- **All cash**: $20K less but guaranteed close
- **Conventional with 20% down**: Strong and reliable
- **FHA/VA**: Lower down payment, more conditions
- **Contingent on buyer's sale**: Higher risk

**3. Timing**
**From the Lecture:**
> "Or the more important particularly in our area here is timing. I've got a promotion I got to be from here to here and the timing is more important. 6 months closing even if it's higher it doesn't work for me that type of thing."

**Timing Scenarios:**
- Seller needs quick close for new job
- Seller needs delayed close for new home purchase
- Coordinated closing dates
- Flexibility on possession date

**4. Contingencies**
- Fewer contingencies = stronger offer
- Inspection contingency (standard)
- Appraisal contingency
- Sale of buyer's home contingency
- Financing contingency

**5. Earnest Money Deposit**
- Higher deposit shows commitment
- Indicates serious buyer
- Financial capability signal

**6. Buyer Strength**
- Pre-approval quality and amount
- Down payment percentage
- Financial reserves
- Past transaction history

**Your Job:**
Present all offers fairly to seller with pros/cons of each, helping seller understand which is truly "best" for their specific situation.

## MLS Syndication

### How Syndication Works

**From the Lecture:**
> "Also when you go into the MLS if your brokers broker has set it up which you always have it puts it out to it it syndicates it to a lot of different websites."

**Automatic Process:**
1. List property in MLS with full details
2. MLS broker/system configured for syndication
3. Listing automatically feeds to aggregator services
4. Distributed to hundreds of websites

**Major Aggregators:**

**ListHub:**
> "This one company called Miss Hub and List Hub has gosh I don't know 500 a 1000 different sites."

- Distributes to 500-1,000+ websites
- Includes newspaper websites
- National real estate portals
- Local community sites
- Search engines

**Other Aggregators:**
- Zillow Group (Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, etc.)
- Realtor.com network
- Redfin
- Homes.com
- Regional/local sites

### Benefits of Syndication

**Massive Exposure:**
> "You don't know somebody from Chicago might be coming in and say 0 smoke look at this this looks good let's go see it that type of thing."

**Reach:**
- Out-of-state buyers relocating
- Buyers searching specific criteria nationally
- Investors looking remotely
- Family members helping with search

**SEO and Discovery:**
- Shows in Google searches
- Multiple pathways to find listing
- Increases visibility exponentially
- Captures buyers on various platforms

**Professional Standard:**
> "So putting your listing in the MOS is the right thing to do for the client."

**Why It's Right:**
- Maximum market exposure
- Best chance at highest/best offer
- Professional representation
- Fiduciary duty fulfilled

### Syndication Compliance

**May 2025 Change:**
> "Starting May 2025, any listing that has been publicly marketed but not added to the MLS within 24 hours will not be published on Zillow—or its subsidiary, Trulia—for the life of the listing."

**Consequences of Non-Compliance:**
- Listing banned from Zillow/Trulia permanently (for that listing)
- Massive loss of potential buyer exposure
- Seller receives reduced marketing
- Potential liability for agent
- Breach of fiduciary duty implications

**Compliance Strategy:**
- Submit to MLS within one business day
- Don't risk waiting
- Better early than late
- Protect listing's syndication eligibility

## New Jersey MLS Specific Requirements

### Multiple MLS Systems in New Jersey

**From the Lecture:**
New Jersey has several MLS systems with slightly different rules:

**1. Hudson County MLS**
- **Strictest**: 24 hours exactly
- Minimal grace period
- Immediate enforcement
- Higher compliance standards

**2. Garden State MLS**
- **Timeline**: 48 hours permitted
- Slightly more flexible than Hudson
- Active enforcement
- Standard compliance requirements

**3. New Jersey MLS (NJMLS)**

- Reasonable compliance approach
- Cooperative during industry transition
- **Recommended for new agents**

**Agent Recommendation:**
> "I do suggest you join New Jersey MLS when you get a chance. We've been trying to get the two combined for a number of years and we thought while we were on top of it an event happened and it didn't happen. It will eventually I believe but right now you got to watch out for your rearing."

### MLS Combination Efforts

**History:**
> "We've been trying to get the two combined for a number of years and we thought while we were on top of it an event happened and it didn't happen."

- Multiple attempts to combine NJ MLSs
- Progress made but not completed
- "Event" derailed recent effort
- Eventually expected to happen

**Current Reality:**
- Multiple MLS systems operating
- Different rules and timelines
- Agents must navigate multiple systems
- Watch submission deadlines carefully

**Future:**

Consolidation expected but timing uncertain.

### Compliance Timelines by MLS

**Hudson County MLS:**

- Very strict enforcement
- File immediately to be safe
- "Hudson Davis 24"

**Garden State MLS:**
- **48 hours** permitted
- "Garden State will give you 48 hours and then those after you"

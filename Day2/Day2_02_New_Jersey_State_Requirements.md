**Official Name:** Real Estate Consumer Protection Enhancement Act (CPEA)
**Signed:** July 2024
**Effective Date:** August 1, 2024 (accelerated from NAR's October timeline)

## Executive Summary

Governor Murphy signed the Real Estate Consumer Protection Enhancement Act into law, implementing stricter requirements than the NAR settlement alone.

**Critical Point:** New Jersey's requirements go beyond federal NAR settlement rules, creating unique state-level compliance obligations.

### Requirement #2: Open House Representation Disclosure (Signage Required)

#### The Legal Requirement
**Paragraph 14 of Bill S3192 (page 17) states:**

"Listing agents are required to disclose who they represent at open houses through signage displayed either at the entrance or on the sign-in sheet."

#### Official Disclosure Language
**Exact wording required:**

> "This is to advise you that the agent who is conducting this Open House REPRESENTS THE SELLER AND IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO act in the seller's best interests."

#### Where to Display

**Option 1: Entrance Signage**
- Clearly visible at front door
- Eye-level placement
- Readable from 3-6 feet away
- Professional appearance

**Option 2: Sign-In Sheet**
- Prominently displayed at top of sheet
- Bold or highlighted text
- Visitors acknowledge by signing
- Maintained with listing file

**Best Practice:** Display BOTH at entrance AND on sign-in sheet for maximum compliance.

#### Obtaining the Disclosure Form

**Official Sources:**
1. Your brokerage office (will provide official form)
2. New Jersey MLS library
3. NJ REALTORS® website download
4. State real estate commission website
5. Staples or print shop (from approved template)

**Digital Access:**
- Download from brokerage platform
- Access through transaction management system
- Print from NJ REALTORS® online forms
- Save to personal template library

#### What You Need at Open House

**Required Documents:**
✅ Open House Disclosure signage (entrance)
✅ Sign-in sheet with disclosure language
✅ Seller property disclosure statement (copies available)
✅ Property survey (if available)
✅ Copy of listing information
✅ Condo/HOA documents (if applicable)
✅ Blank buyer agency agreement forms

**Optional But Recommended:**
- Property brochures/flyers
- Neighborhood information
- School district data
- Utility cost estimates
- Recent comparable sales

#### Governor's Perspective on Open Houses

**State Legislature's Concern:**
The Governor and legislature believe agents at open houses might "pounce on" unrepresented buyers and "make them sign" contracts under pressure.

**Actual Intent:**
The disclosure protects both parties by clearly establishing:
- The agent represents the SELLER only
- The visitor is unrepresented
- Buyer should consider their own representation
- Information gathering is appropriate, but agency is clear

#### What You CAN Do at Open House

**Permitted Activities:**
✅ Show the property's features
✅ Answer questions about the house
✅ Provide property information sheets
✅ Discuss the neighborhood
✅ Explain listing terms (price, taxes, etc.)
✅ Provide seller's disclosure documents
✅ Collect contact information

**Must Be Careful With:**
⚠️ Buyer's financial information
⚠️ Buyer's motivation or timeline
⚠️ Buyer's relationship status
⚠️ Other properties they're considering
⚠️ Their maximum price range

**Why:** You represent the SELLER. Any information that helps the seller negotiate should be shared with the seller, which isn't in the buyer's interest.

#### What You CANNOT Do During Open House Hours

**Prohibited Activities:**
❌ Sign buyer agency agreements
❌ Write offers during open house hours
❌ Negotiate on behalf of buyers
❌ Provide buyer-specific advice
❌ Discuss buyer strategy
❌ Show other properties

#### What You CAN Do AFTER Open House Ends

**Post-Open House Options:**

**Option 1: Write Offer as Seller's Agent**
- Close the open house officially
- State the established hours have ended
- Write contract representing seller only
- Provide neutral contract services
- Buyer remains unrepresented in negotiations

**Option 2: Designate Another Agent**
- Assign another agent from your brokerage
- That agent signs buyer agency agreement
- You continue representing seller
- Creates clean separation of representation

**Option 3: Buyer Gets Own Agent**
- Buyer contacts their own agent
- Their agent writes the offer
- Clean transaction with separate representation
- Recommended approach

#### Timing Considerations

**Open House Hours:** 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM

**Scenario 1: Late Arrival (4:10 PM)**
- Open house officially ended at 4:00 PM
- You can write contract after closing
- Establish appointment for 4:30 PM or later
- Document that open house was closed

**Scenario 2: During Hours (2:30 PM)**
- Cannot write contract until after 4:00 PM
- Can schedule appointment for after closing
- Continue showing property to other visitors
- Maintain seller representation only

**Best Practice:**
- Build in 30-minute buffer after stated end time
- "Open house ends at 4:00, I can meet you at 4:30"
- Accounts for stragglers and cleanup
- Provides professional transition time

- No exception for open houses (if showing other properties)

#### Open House Exception

**Important Distinction:**

**Why Box #2 Recommended:**
- Allows showing ALL properties (including your listings)

- Doesn't restrict buyer's options

**If "Buyer Agent Only" Selected:**

**Options:**

| Duration | Use Case | Pros | Cons |

| **30 Days** | Single house showing, specific search | Reasonable timeframe | Short for full search |
| **3 Months** | Active search, local buyers | Adequate for most searches | Standard timeline |
| **6 Months** | Comprehensive search, tight inventory | Aligns with listing terms | Long commitment |
| **One House** | Specific property only | No ongoing obligation | Limits follow-up |

**Flexibility Built In:**
- "Let's work together for one week while you're visiting"
- "We can always extend if it's working well"
- "If it doesn't work out, we can terminate easily"

**4. Termination Provisions**

**New Jersey Standard:**
- Written notice required

- No penalties or fees for termination
- Simple and straightforward

**When Buyer Has Existing Agreement:**

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I accidentally showed a property without a signed buyer agreement?**
A: Stop immediately, explain the requirement, obtain signed agreement before showing any additional properties, and document what happened with your broker.

**Q: Can I write an offer at an open house if the buyer really wants to make an offer immediately?**
A: Yes, but only AFTER the open house officially ends. Close the open house, then write the contract while representing the seller.

**Q: What if a seller refuses to complete the property disclosure?**
A: The listing cannot go live until it's completed. Explain this is a legal requirement, not optional. Consider declining the listing if seller won't comply.

**Q: Do I need the disclosure sign if I have it on my sign-in sheet?**
A: The law allows either location, but best practice is BOTH for maximum compliance and visibility.

**Q: What if an investigator shows up at my open house?**
A: Treat them like any other visitor, demonstrate full compliance, answer questions professionally, and follow all procedures. If compliant, you'll receive approval status.

Casual but that'll just play right into this You need to have a business plan and plan with activities what we see with agents and what I found with my own self in the beginning until I got a plan as I go in and I didn't know what to do and I just sit there you don't make any money just sitting there and you're saying what do I do what do I do motivated you got it we're going to make yourself a business plan and we'll get to the plan It doesn't have to be a huge plan it needs to be one that you will do And to start it off III got an office opened an office for a friend of mine who Rutherford a number of days back and the staff I had actually 15 of them paid from one office to my office There was another 10 from other offices and within about three months I had a staff of 25 people who had no plans and showed up and didn't know what to do but they did business because they knew people right so we had to expand this because we were new no market share and we wanted to be a dominant player in the market so I called a friend of mine who I had done training with and work dirt filters and I was there for over 20 years and I thought it was like it's like this company it was the Rolls Royce of real estate and it's really a wonderful company and I called her up and I said I got a big problem I've got a lot of people and they do some business but it's not together we need to pull it together so she and I really plan we took stuff off the Internet and whatever and pulled it together what we did we decided to do a Saturday and we took a white board and we just started writing where people got business and here it is circle prospective circle prospecting you get a listing and you do five 5 houses on this side 5 houses on that side and 10 on the other side or something like that 10 fives and that was you get the listing and you introduce yourself to the neighbors they don't know who you are and it's very easy to do You just knock on the doors if you might want to check with the town and make sure you don't you're not violating some permits or something but even even then most people don't bother you we do it for open houses we do it for new listings and we do it for for for sold And it's it's to try to get that relationship started and maybe more business now what you're not going to do I was taught by an old guy who did 100 listings a year I never did 100 most ever did is 27 this guy was phenomenal and all he did is went up and down the streets and knocked on people's doors so you want to sell your house I said to Kim you got to be kidding because I was ready to quit you know III was one of those who went in and sat down and didn't know what to do So he took me aside he said First off it's door knocking not doorbell ringing Doorbell ringing is strangers door knocking is people generally in the neighborhood are people your family who know you they not gonna they don't ring a doorbell they're familiar with you I never even thought about that but it's true and I found it out because I tried it when I was young and I tried everything just to make sure you know what worked for me and you're going to be doing the same thing right you're going to try this stuff you're going to try the words the phrases that you use if they frown when you use the phrase get rid of it and get something else go to chat GPT and write a new phrase whatever But you're going to be cognizant of what's going on with you in the world around you so the Knockador it's really simple you have your business card in your hand or your in this case you got a new listing or you're holding an open house you got to open house fire right and you you go up and you knock three times not three times on the ceiling you ever hear that song This is corny showing your Brandy yeah my age right Oh my goodness that's when I was in college wow that's a long time ago like not three times That sounds more real turn away people in this area are really afraid First off they answer the door so you probably have a storm door that's locked you know there and when they open the door you have it in your hand Slowly that don't go like this 'caus.... you know they're frightened to death


Christians international real Estate the reason I'm knocking on your door today is I have an open house down the street on Sunday and we're inviting the neighbors I have a copy of the listing here on on the flyer here So I'm saying slide it under the door whatever and then you'll get the talky ones you know but you get the message out they find out who you are and they see who you are you're calm you're relaxed you're not rushing no no you do this and make sure you relax and you do it very easily put them at ease get the information to them and grew up in house and it does work and I had one where we did it in this office I was talking about before because I had to teach them and we went up and down the street with Ferroni I think and up up and then we came down the other side and we found out that parents had both passed and the 3 siblings were getting the house ready preparing it to sell so we put them on prospecting that's one thing you need to do is prospecting with the MLS make sure you know how to do it because you can watch the comments you can do it through platform actually would be better go in do your market study and send it to them and it will track it when it opens and so forth when they open it and they take a look at it and study it so it was Carl and I and we did it and she said you think we better I don't know supposed to give it a shot right so we introduced ourselves we walked through the house we put them on prospecting we sent them a market study which they liked and we just watched it The sister watches it for and we about it was maybe 30 days later somewhere like that all three of the siblings opened the market study I called Carol I said to get ready to list the house they all opened up they all opened that market study last night so she calls up and she said I just wanted to follow up with you it's been about a month how you make it out so wow you must have ESP we're ready to go And she got the listing This is why you do this type of thing you know and there are many different types of people you'll find when you're not going to do it I knocked on the door one time and the guy said oh I've been wanting to meet you come in sit down have a cup of coffee an hour an hour and a half lady and watch out and sometimes you're like captive but have look at your phone and say Oh my gosh I've got to go back to the office so you can get up the guy was wonderful he was a lovely guy and he was thinking about selling his house in the next five years he wanted to see who I was All right that's fine you do that it's good circle prospecting is good and as I said you can do it in many different ways and it doesn't only have to be your listing right and it is going to echo what Randy said by this when I realized how important it was first of all the National Association of Realtors puts out a statement that blew my mind 86% of people list with the first person they speak to right got to be first so you got to be first number one #2 my experience and everybody elses experience is that whenever one house sells in a neighborhood within a year to a year and 1/2 3 other homes will come on the they get the idea so circle marketing is the way to go for new people and don't think you're going to have competition I know major teams that call me and say I don't understand it I got this great listing and then some of the neighbors listed with somebody else and I said well team circle marketing no they're not so you're waking it up you opened it up for somebody else so don't think you're you're going to be up against major people doing it they're just not doing it you know a lot of people now are waiting for social media to do everything for them there is an opportunity a window that's open for you to make sure you do the leg work I tell you about to lie out of Scarsdale Westchester right I tutor her and she when she first came on she was doing 5 million and she says not enough I want to do 10 said OK so here's what we do we do you know we started with a circle marketing and the farm and the mail outs so she calls me up it was summer it was still light out but it was like 536 o'clock and she said burn i'm so embarrassed I just picked my son up from basketball and all the cards that I was going to mail out our city in my car I forgot to mail them so I said no problem So you know get on the phone and call everybody instead what she did was she got her cards and she walked the whole neighborhood That year she got two houses one was a million 71 was 1,000,003 and within six months from then there was another listing she was called in to do and the wife wanted to list with her but the husband said oh no I have a friend and the wife said you see that woman walking around she works really hard we're listing with her and she got her so she got three listings almost totaling $5 million that year in that year and a half Amazing it is it is amazing so there's no reason not to do it during my career I had that happen twice fielding in Glen Rock I got three houses on that street within 18 months and Litchfield and Ridgewood and I got the first one and then the one across the street the next one across the street and another one across the street yeah and now by the way to Tulay is on her way to 25 million a year wow nice good it does work and it and it doesn't take much time to do this better times to do it it's a Saturday or a snowy day I love love love snowy rainy days right because everybody's home and more people are home now because they're only working my grandsons work in the city they really only go in three days a week they're home Yeah it does pay when I first heard it I thought oh God right but it worked and of course once you get it to work for you you know yours like hooked Yeah and in your time blocking they're all supposed to when we go to the business but have been working on their diary because I feel that if you interfere with somebody's life it won't get done so you have to be finding the gaps in their lifestyle that we can fit this in so when you time block the first thing you should time block in your early morning 1 is to see what's sold in the area that you're familiar with or around your neighborhood and that's the house that if it just sold start calling and saying hi just want to call you let you know that your neighbors home just sold do you know anybody else who might be thinking of moving we have loads of customers for your great neighborhood and that's the words the right words moving not selling not buying because they don't know where they're going to sell or buy but they're talking about moving yeah I took that from you That is the right traits and I didn't learn that for a while and when I did it just changed my business totally I got a lot more leads I did my calls in the early morning you know and it works for me but that was part of my plan when you get to the plan you will plan your day and you will plan it with positive things that will go and reach out and get this support this is one thing you have to do every single day find you this every day you've got to find some new business you got to build a pipeline because the mortgage payment comes every month the rent check has to be paid every month the card payment college payment insurance you need to build a pipeline so that you know three months down the road


Keeps coming yeah same here not a lot but I still get it going to target market target markets like you pick a high rise and you work the high rise you pick a neighborhood you work the neighborhood whatever all right what I suggest before you do that is check and see what the turnover rate is If you pick Midland Park Park and told me you've got a target as they forget it because the houses passed from generation to generation to generation it's not enough turnover there for me it's very low inventory always it's just not enough for me you pick farallon you got turnover galore It's like almost 400 houses a year selling feral certain high rises they move in and out you know so forth I always that's how I picked a target market if I was going to do it I just made sure that I was I had turnover now I was a transplant there are people who like Carmelo Roselli for example University and Duran Mcgovern six kids they know everybody in town That's their target market Whole town was their target market and they really did very well They got 7580% of the listings in town so when you look at your target your market and say listen I can do this I can get business from here I can get it from there targeted nurture it you know we had one agent she joined a group and she decided that was going to be her target market and they had a luncheon and they needed flowers centerpieces I said put in the centerpieces she went out and picked out really nice centerpieces and put them there and he said who get this she was new to the group she said I did it I wanted to introduce myself to everybody and let them know who I was Interestingly enough they didn't forget her name she was automatically in their book so you can do things like that You just keep connected keep connected keep reaching reaching out OK Mailings digital and print mailings are generally postcards now people will look at a postcard letters if they do like I do in the mailroom I go to the mailroom and I pick it up and there's a trash can a big trash can I go through and throws it out and just keeps certain stuff you know that's the way of the world so if you do it postcard is I find really the best way you have a picture of a house on the front they're going to turn over to look in the back and find out who it was So just listed just souls I'm all for all right there are times that you can't send postcards and do you know what used to do this she had friends who were into sports and they got the schedule for the Giants and the Jets and the Mets and the Yankees and she mailed them she mailed them the schedules you know on a postcard it was really interesting she had a lot of business you know that was her niche and her friends So look and see what you got in common pick a target market that you could extract with business from OK the mailing and bill print do a lot of digital you don't have to do a lot here when you got when everyone of you had your license come in you got an email from Charlie Botello with the websites to fill out or to log into and and get started that's that goes to marketing marketing post for you All that beautiful Christy stuff it's out there it's posted to your account automatically so my dad accounts came alive they were resurrected because I was not posting anything and I got to this company and they said they're going to do it for me I said Amen I'm going to be a living person now I have to do some posting on my own and if you do need a special posting and I have an agent right now that really had a very good year and it was a growth year for him I said you send them a well Kyle is one of them he got two sales Send marketing a request that you got two good sales for the month and get it out to his social media network they'll they'll develop it for you and get it out there so you can really pick up on your network through the company and the company postings and and I put things about Trista I don't know well none of you follow me One of my agents Nicole I think got me started on doing she said you need to do a real I said I don't even know what a reel is and she is so good at it yeah yeah I said I really don't know what a real is she says just a short video clip that you put out I said fine I don't know how to do it she said don't worry I know how to do it we're going to do the tie of the day so I started the tie of the day right and she we we she directs me you know she tells me what to do and I do it you know when I open the car door one was pointed at the screen you know activity and what's he doing what's he doing type thing and then I look at her 0 you're here you want to see the tie of the day and I do that do you know my Linkedin went over 1000 hits I was like whoa and then I can follow it and I'm getting like 5 600 people heading this real I think I thought it was corny my son said kill it It wasn't Cory it works you can do reels and you get stuff like that even if it's cordy probably corny is better you know you've got ways to get out there in social media We had hat leanings Helen Helen Cahill the big cat when you saw the hat you knew it was hell you know there are people who have visual hooks they're called hooks Was she Korean I think I saw her in the meeting I speak at yeah that's that's a it's a visual and people women particularly use visual hubs I use the visual hub i'm probably the only man in a suit in a tie That's that's a visual hook now because everybody else you don't have to wear it I have to wear a meter I should you know as the manager here but still you know I'm different I stand out you want to you want to be different you know so if you have a visual hook some people have hairstyles and and I and I remember certain men with certain hairstyles and women with certain hairstyles that were really outstanding or different and I saw them you know use the visual hope in with it you know and put a reel you know what the heck./.


blue tie -> as my pesnal hook. or other recommendation Claude code?


Rhoda Helper and said my office and she said Granny you're all missing they both do Thanksgiving you can touch people at Thanksgiving they're taking a break with their families before the holiday do something for Thanksgiving you got to do a mailing or a postcard for Thanksgiving they can see it thanks for supporting me and my my business for this past year and that type of thing The whole office good morning to Thanksgiving a good step OK and your neighbor welcome that's a good one we have a competitor across the street that will solicit in a very nice way our clients when they close on the House they'll go take a bottle of wine they'll invite them to dinner they'll take them a cake welcome to the neighborhood I work for this They actually Target I work for Target Realtors I do a lot of business neighborhood you'll meet a lot of people I'll invite you to the parties and so forth and they just like take them into their group got to watch out you can do it yourself all right welcome new neighbors is a very good thing certainly you should welcome them whether you've got somebody like that or not any help because it works OK personal notes and I got to go get my notes


personal notes:

These are people who want my business These are people who want me to know them OK and remember and guess what when they write a note I do remember the best the best one I've seen is one of my agents here in my office I love her card all she did was she put her name on the front It's Mike inside she writes a note on the back It's her first and last initial with a key between it separating it and her information And I said geez that's that's really plain she said all I wanted to know is my name I want him to remember my name and that's the reason for the card and then the note goes inside I'll let you cancel it that is my favorite of all time and I will tell you she does a lot of business She never does less 7 to 10:00 AM that's really well now there's all sorts of things you can buy about it at the store and so forth Now keep do yourself clear by the way this was done by Sir Speedy this was done very economically and so chief economically but people are doing notes personal notes are memorable and if you have to mail one and it's this side now she has a larger size people always open it up because they think it's an invitation to a wedding or a party or something else they always open it up they don't throw it up I always keep the smaller ones so you know you got to be resourceful But notes work around everybody take 5 and start you have some OK and tonight make out a card to somebody I say in the beginning your sphere of influence just anybody and put that there's there's a dialog there you can use from a card I just read to them before that I love and that's great and all go to Staples and buy orange or green envelopes because people won't open it if they see II mean I do have the envelopes for those but I don't use them because people won't open them up so if it's green or Thanksgiving orange in color or rust or something they're going to open it think it's an invite That's another point You can have that in your book it wasn't in there but it's fine I have I have it somewhere I got it did you leave that person I would say I remember you I like you and I care for you they have a hidden message that's very very strong I highly recommend our phone reviews in the phone text are for quickness I'm late I'll be there in 15 minutes What are the directions that's the quickie little stuff then emails are for everything that you need to store in documents and so forth or if you need to track actually in the virus see there were two things that I forgot to tell you guys all around right With email how do you track do you track the showings and I didn't tell you that I forgot to tell you what I did the fire agency how do you confirm that you showed them the property you said a nice little message an email and you try and you say this is we saw the ABCD today what did you think of it would they reply to automatically dialing records that they saw that property richard email is very important it does that it keeps all your documents you can organize it in Outlook I have spoken to lore and Outlook look and when when Google was breached the other day and I couldn't get it I was having a stroke because I couldn't get to my stuff and I there was a document I needed say them they're good stuff I have a question showing times II recommend that you all use showing time when you show a property how long does the record of that stay do you have any do you know what I would say 6 months OK is what the purge is so that's another way you can check that yeah you can check that you showed because if you have a lock box it records them if you put it on showing time and they make the appointments to showing time you got a record of the showing from the agents and so forth and also feedback yeah and but the only thing is on showing time it does request that you put the name of the customer I would never put the name of the customer unless you have a 6 month buyer's agreement you know but they could be canceled in 24 hours yeah so I would not give out the name so maybe it isn't a good record because you're not you just say you show the property you don't you don't have the name in there well you have to trust the other agent Any any reason you don't put the names Yeah II am not not in the system you know they say the system's tight and it's close and I believe it but I don't believe it can just put a initial or JC because I like to show them as to my client that I showed this many houses to you JC from NYC OK What about JC from NYC NYC Oh yes I sold another house thanks yeah you could do stuff like that beetle yeah that sounds good that's a nice i'm gonna keep that one definitely alright so going back to your phones your emails are invaluable they're your records they're your record keeping so that's how what that is for your phone is with your clients we have us a group a society where it's becoming personal and you cannot do that when your client is you're working with them steadily You need to be on the phone with them they want a phone call you are holding their hand and walking them through the process if you don't call them they jump ship they want to talk to you they want to communicate they want to know what's going on with their transaction they want to know what's coming on the market they want that phone call I had an agent and I'll give you an example of somebody who lost a good career she says I have not answered my phone anymore I got to do text I said Eric that's really risky and dangerous you've got a great career but don't lose it Well guess what she lost it because they thought she went out of business She didn't answer the phone but she quit Watch your phone usage watch your client ask your client it's OK and I do this quite often I do it actually all the time how do you want me to communicate with you and how much I have one guy called me up one time stop it it's too much so how often and how much Once a week is good for me fine I went to once a week and he was happy as a client so you might want to ask I was I was overdoing it with this guy watch your phone usage use it wisely and and make sure you keep that connection in that contact know the inventory seizing there's not much of it back then further I could tell you when there was over a hundred and thirty five forty houses for sale in Ridgewood and you're like Oh my God you know what have you got 14 today I think something like that That's easy to know go on inspections go out on open houses all right learn your market if you go if you go to put a house on the market guess what they're going to ask you about the house that's sold down the street the one that's on the market in this know your inventory if you don't know the inventory they walk they get somebody else you really need to know your inventory and it's easy to catch up with our MOS you go in and say it's out of your normal area you go in you take a look at what's for sale what's under contract and what's sold in the last 90 days and educate yourself and if you need drive the neighborhood before you make that appointment and get in there and start talking because they're going to find out that you either know it or you don't all right and I saw an agent lose one right in front of my eyes We brought the client in and it was another office it wasn't this one I died The presentation on on this screen we're going through it and we agent was asked did you see this house What about this house I didn't get that one that one then second house I didn't get that one either and they're looking at each other It was a couple and they got to the 3rd one 3 strikes are out they said you know what we want to go for lunch they said we'll never see them again and we didn't you know she didn't know her inventory she was not prepared you need to prepare you need to know the inventory even if you don't know the town you know you can do it Help from your manager or somebody who lives in the town you can phone up on it quickly Go to the MLS figure figure out what's there and what's selling yes I've eight years now and I see there is one person in my town that she has it locked down like which town Cresco Arley yeah I don't know our kids have it locked up yeah like our kids became agents You like even to go to rental you have to go through her like II do her and I know my she's got a big team she has 11 I think about 11 of her How do I overcome that like I make relationships infiltrate yeah that's what I want that's what infiltrate one of the reasons why I became an agent that's why and then beat out orally yeah OK and then I'll coach you and then Taylor Yeah Christina's right with her christina here Christina Taylor lucy and she are the top three in the MLS We work out together and he set the chip in me and I'm supposed to get everybody on your team that you possibly can infiltrate it not everybody's going to like her just know this it's everybody else in the world Some like you some don't you know you like them you don't like them not everybody's going to like you're going to get some business yeah no that's and you're right you you found her the crack in her facade I mean that she is rude to other agents too so do you live in Cresco right now and my kids like she has picked up my daughters from my house to go on and play dates like so so I what I think you should do too is get involved in the town every town is looking for volunteers Everybody knows me OK that's good use it keep those connections going and furnace right you've seen the crack in her facade I when I went for a listing I tell all my secrets I always look to see who my competition would be and sometimes I knew him and sometimes I didn't I would find out you know what who they were and I would tailor make my presentation by verbal presentation to things that would knock them out I called knockout tractors and I knew what certain agents said and did and I would never say anything negative you want to be positive and say now I know people do this and I know people do that I don't do that this is how I handle it I just knocked that agent out of the box and I go to the next stage you know this competitive business and I was and I'm A competitor Yeah and Carlo when Christina Gibbons started we didn't have a Ridgewood office she was in she was my customer I sold her her house and then she came on board She wanted to be the number one agent in Ridgewood she is and she is now but she was competing against Harvard Real Estate which for centuries was the number one people in Ridgewood they got every bit of business in town and I'll tell you as we have time I'll go over with everybody how you can be orally out on a slow process one of the things she did in the beginning was to have a party and then she rented a rented roots and she invited the mayor she invited everybody to announce her new business and then what she started doing was where no and she did it when there was a lot of competition now your local papers have no competition You put a nice quarter page ad in with all your references every single week for a while believe me it works because the bot the sellers are are older now they're still reading the newspaper There is a handful of people that are are real sellers that are still reading the newspaper and so I would definitely do that yeah I I've done advanced for a private gym that III participated in the events in my town and this I like I speak to the mayor like different like he has come to our events like car show events at our private gym in town this is where I met Taylor You asked him to send you leads to Tina no I'm not do you ask your group to send you leads well I wasn't an agent then became an agent you start asking and make sure you all nicely and courteously at the end of my phone calls I would make those phone calls religiously every month I had a Rolodex I went through the mall and I would say make that nice chat and then I would say by the way have you heard of anyone moving would you please recommend start asking I'm constantly dressed for success I know it sounds crazy but dressed for success you know where I know but I am telling you that there is a pool of sellers out there So like even I wish I had my cards and my marketing so that I can hand out for this weekend because I invited to the outline Country Club one of the one of the guys goes down OK so you don't have any cards yet OK so does your office have any blank cards Take one of my cards go to Insta Print have it make up a flip card so instant print you know like go to what is it called speedy Sir Speedy just have enough to hand out for me which works I have and make sure it's with a tie the office you can just delete that and the photo instantly there yeah I mean that's not what you want to use forever no but temporary card but there 'd be temporary and there's no reason why not I mean every problem every problem has a solution in place when did they place the order for your card i'm not sure IIII just sent Melanie my child a few days ago oh so it's not done it takes about a week to 10 days to get them but you have a headshot you can give it to the printer yeah yeah you can just email it to yourself and there's a there's a great printed a lot of people use in Hohokus I forgot their name Yeah but they can do it they can do it fast 117 they'll make signs cards whatever in 24 hours 17 then Ramsey I can't remember the name of the company it's just bright north of Pleasant Avenue why not and I just noticed one of my friends and I just I lost this phone he's a big filter and then I go to see some of his parents house I'm going to go knock on his door like it was going on ever you know reintroduce myself but he was a he is a really good friend of mine but I changed numbers and so we lost contact but I could list that you got to reestablish all that got to read you know what that goes on your business plan I would put that number one reestablish all those relationships I would put that down OK training platform platform has a beautiful digital presentation for fire agents or for buyers and one for sellers they're personalized you can email them and it's advisable to email them ahead of time 24 hours at least so they can sit and look through it and not spend the time with you going on a power point on the screen we used to do it on the screen and then then it got too many slides and nobody wanted to watch it so we sent it now ahead of time it's a gorgeous product and get it out there platform you should well you're going to have Mark come in right do platform you'll have two days of platform 3 days now this this is your CRM contact management program It has all the documents and things that you might are all the marketing pieces that you might want and you don't have to pay for Go outside and pay for somebody You took that That'll help all You got the information right on your CIREG or did you get it no he had sent out an email he sent an email out to everybody so he's going to do it where it's in person where he can be in person online everything do it in person can we access you have the notice oh OK yeah OK you have the notice you could you could watch it online but if you got a chance to be in person so the I think the 1st one the 1st one the 1st day is November what day was it in 12 and it's going to be in Mahwah right and it starts at what time 11 I think he said I have it in here too Which is up on Macarthur Boulevard b....sure if they're going for both states Which is up on Macarthur Blvd because they have a huge room and they're anticipating a lot of people coming I don't think that that's going to really happen so yeah I'm not sure if they're going for both states

they're gorgeous not like the old cartoons we used to use referral agents right now we have a changing business and particularly with some of the older agents who look at bio agency and they say oh God another change has been Scott had it the throne in the top all right grab their license or they may have a huge following that you might be able to make an arrangement with them to work their sphere of influence and have their network they might share their network with you in in their retirement now yeah absolutely You could really do well christina has one yeah absolutely the agent said i'm out i'm retiring from the business i'm going into another business and I want to make an arrangement with you I'll give you all my clients she had a ton and also you can do things like this and you can have a mentor or a buddy who decides they're going to move out of the area or whatever maurice's body moved out of area all of her business comes down with Marissa you know so you can do hookups like that and get business II what happened to me was I hit a ceiling and I couldn't get bothered and my manager came and said get some referral agents and I knew some people who had taken other positions and so forth and we're going into referral I called them up and put them in my name and I called them every month and let them give me business I pay them 25% and my business went up to the next level So before allegiance are good social media I think it's two days yeah the first one is the 12th and he's i'm sorry to interrupt but because this is so confusing what he's done he's trying and never to but the we don't know where the 2nd one's going to be yet Are we going to both of them you should go all three of them yeah but this will be your lifeblood So he's starting in

13th not a Wednesday Thursday November 13th OK so that you must have your computers you must have your templates your everything done and you will learn how to do zip forms OK all right we'll go to 12 social media we talked about social media and I think I need to cover a whole lot more on that google business is now the place to go mark will be covering it with you make sure you're there and you have your domain name OK industry credentials when we were doing by our agency I didn't tell you that we have an industry course where you can get a designation for being a buyer an accredited buyer Rep I got mine years ago and then I went back and got it and redid the course again this year it's ABR accredited buyer representative it covers agency it's really an agency course it started as a buyer agency course by people out in Colorado they just never renamed it you will learn agency inside and out there are two areas that are business where we are at great risk fair housing and agency representation I would II recommend that you get it First off when you get once you get the designation you can put it on your card that is like John Smith John Smith this John Smith that Which one would you pick the one with more credentials generally right so II tell all my agents they need to do it this is a must all right in our industry right now There are other things search search the New Jersey MLS or Greater Bergen actually search for the Berg NJ Los will announce it the greater Bergen has the schedule in the roster you can get senior SRES Senior Representative at Home Diversity you can get short sales foreclosures SFR there's a lot of different courses that will give you like one day courses 2 day courses that will give you a credential that you can put on your business card as well as life my my advice Randy at this point because you're going to be thrown so much stuff from here yeah not to take any more courses except for AVR except for ABR when you can and that starts in in January here at Greater Burger and and if you're still overwhelmed I wouldn't even take that until maybe you have a year into under your belt because you can't get the designation unless you have some sales anyway you know so but you want the knowledge yeah you do want the knowledge I will tell you as a broker when I went back to it the second time the Rhodolateral Ross she is excellent she really gives it to you she she just spits it out this is what you have to do and this is the way you do it And she moves on She really does a great course It was a fabulous course but it's knowledge you should absolutely have cold all right yeah all right now I'm going to the next piece pieces here we'll get these out




Plan your day
Who shared his business plan everybody get one You got a spare and he planned his business state because otherwise you come in and sit there and you get nothing you go home empty handed right This is the form he used I
프리파이널 리셋 machine set 슬라이드 Technology cult all right lead generation that's all we've been talking about today is nearly the pipeline your network that is the one thing let's go back to what I said before the one thing you must do every single day you're in this business is find new business you have to do that organize your sphere of influence in the CRM Best platform all right those are only three areas that we have to really address If that it says five strategies for each priority you don't go there you're new to the business you're going to pick things that you will do things you like to do and certainly things that are going to generate business for OK that's what you're going to put down if you're good at phone calls you're good at knocking doors that's great Whatever you are good at or you want to be good at and you will do and commit to do don't do it halfway because half measure is available They don't get you anywhere you have to pick something that you would like to do and something that you will do and commit to do every day and put it in your schedule don't put stuff in for frost 'cause you're not going to do it anyhow since the waste of the page all right put the real stuff down OK the technology we got plenty at the MOS stop here too that you are lead generation I can emphasize that enough in sphere of influence All right for lead generation I would put maybe more than one because you're starting fresh you're going to look out I mean some of you might say as I try to tell you give you an example I belong to this congregation a church I am going to put my business card in there and I'm going to meet every many everybody I can in the church and I'm going to join one of the committees of the church that's that I did our club the same thing i'm going to put my my business card or have my business card put on all the programs and I'm going to do this and that and the other to make sure everybody in the club knows me and knows that I'm in real estate that is one of the strategies that you could use there for lead generation the other one is I'm going to do like Christina i'm going to throw a big party when I had them all in about the mayor I'm going to have the assistant the vice mayor i'm going to have somebody on the the planning board if you're into construction things like this the borough engineer if you want it I mean probably the people that that you need to know and that boost your career Oh wait training course Is yeah they will and they'll recommend you part was really good Who told us all the inside scoop you know building management if you're in a high rise situation get ahold of the Super super knows everything about everybody but the building manager building managers probably a little more tight left the Super they'll tell you Find the one who knows everything actually I found a lady on Thornbury in Grandma who knew everybody's business on the street I just I was making my calls you know and going up and down the street looking for a house is when I was looking for because I'm fired and I got hurt and she wanted to talk Oh yeah come over have a cup of tea and so forth and I thought well let's let's give it a shot she knew everybody's business she was a good source look for a source of business look for that business out there and put that down and commit to it i'm going to work this source and it's the source is a dead so dead source take it off pencils have erasers Get rid of it fast fail get rid of that one put another one in this place something is going to work Really II work this business intensely I have to take and if you it's not that it takes my whole life but when I do it I have a plan and I go do it and then I can go have a lunch you know just keep the plan going OK and your sphere of influence that is worth its waiting though even people who can't type contract can tie up the market as we well saw you know it's just amazing i'm going to give you a copy of this guy's so so I have already it's just not in color I know it didn't do it color so but I will take them for the next group of books unless you need them you know you want presentation I have I'll just give it to you now So Chairman call I have one you you have it already I don't remember if I gave it to now this is a senior agents plan that is too much for me I have to take but it gives you suggestions of what a senior agent does he was a top producer in California to need more time What is your advice where we should target our where you should target yeah you know if where where do you live If we will start in one neighborhood then switch somewhere else it's not worth it or it's good idea or so so let read the answer and then I'll tell you how there's three different processes that we go through that there I will tell you that 11 thing I found if I decided to put one on my sheet I would go after it now if you go to do an area it's going to take longer time for it to happen all right but I go after if it's a dead end man I dumped it and put something in its place but you got to give it the right amount of time to have happen all right but some things are quicker than others And just watch it very closely and it's OK to take it off the sheet I mean you're not tied to it for life it's your plan It's not my plan I don't ask my agents for the plan I just do the plan or help them do the plan so that they have a structured day you got to have a structured day or you're not going to make any money in this business you've got to be structured you have to be structured but if it's a dead end you don't want it on your sheet get it off and put something else out of space and there we are lucky now because we have remind so Sammy Maloof will be coming here and going over Remind with you So what what you can do is you can take a larger piece of the territory you know like two 150 families 300 families but then you can filter them with remind as to anybody who's been in their house for thirty years or 20 years anybody who's over certain age anybody you know there's all kinds of filters you can put on there and then you may have 300 people in that sphere that you have but you may only be sending out to 70 are you know and that way no not enough to say that somebody who is only in their house three years gets a job transfer and you might have missed out on them but once you start getting listings they'll see your signs and you'll probably So what what I suggest is you every month you would hit the 70 and maybe every two months the entire or every three months the entire 250 people you know that's one way it's not like farming is not my for first for brand new people to get money it's a long term it's a long term it has to be something has to go out every month for a year before you get return on it usually circle markings might yeah you got it because and sometimes you can pick your territory by the listing that you get during circle marketing so if you get a house that lists with you while you're doing your circle marketing you can then include the neighbors of that that and by the way it doesn't have to be one territory you know it could be where you circle market here and then on the other side here 50 there 100 there you know I'll show you we go into that in depth all right that's great thank you but but I wait till Sammy goes over her mind because there's no sense in doing it when you don't have the telephone numbers or the emails or the addresses what we're doing today is giving you the basics now you're going to have Sammy Maloof come in you're going to have Wendy come in you're going to have Slava come in and they're going to start building these pieces for you for your plant the important thing is to have a structured day and a plan so that you can make a career in this business and make a good living commissions are big It's so easy to lose your way in this business it's so easy to wake up in the morning and not know what I'm doing next and that's what we want to fight and avoid it's too easy do that so that's why I'm saying you keeping your Diaries I hope of what you're doing from morning I don't care wake up in the morning walk your dog take your kids to school whatever you're doing and time it and then when we find those time gaps that's when we do we we start putting in our plan because if I interfere with you taking your kids to school you'll never get it done right so so we got a time block and and if you have another business going and you need to be here at a certain time and I'm saying make your calls at that certain time never gonna work so I need your schedules and you need them and then we figure out the time block and your schedule will get interrupted because hopefully you're gonna have appointments yeah I think Giancarlo has like three businesses going I don't know how he does it but yeah it's it's just amazing I gave you another sheet here now we were talking about taking the pencil and the eraser to your business plan well you do the same thing with your clients I got this from a monthary I I've attended a lot of sales training modules from different trainers through the years and I got this from Mike Ferry organization now his son is doing it what's his sons name I can't remember I got to tell you he did have some very good points yes he he was up tough **** I mean he was just really tough at his training however I came away with the sheep and what we did was an off as an office we took everybody we were working with we put them on the sheet and went through Are they are they committed number one are they committed to doing something with me number what's their timeline so we had our leads and I'll tell you one session I went through with Samira she had about 2 or 3 pages of leads and we went through we said this one is this one is running around we've gone through and knocking off the deadlift the ones that weren't I mean she's working and she's trying to help him and hoping they might swing in right What the goal was was to get down to the 10 best ones the ones that we knew were going to do something the ones that were going to do something with us they were working with us and how soon were they going to do something now this is managing this pipeline of business all right so we got here we put them in what they were going to do their price range and then we rated them how quick by the timing right and I was the number one and this is they do one is the lowest I reversed it One that's my top one boy they're going to buy something within the next 30 days to six weeks i'm going to stay on them on top of them all the time i'm going to answer the phone i'm going to make sure I get this one done all right i'm going to make this sale on this one then you can do 2 maybe it's three months you can do 3 that's six months now the the road find out the timing because you got to know who to spend the most time with right it's not that you're not going to spend time on each one but you know the timing their timing now they can go from the lowest number say they're a year out or say you know if I ever sell my house I'll use you all right well they're on your list of contacts and you keep them there and you keep the body warm all those years that's your CRM sending out stuff to them all right and keep in contact and saying I remember you I still care about you when you're ready to do business I'll do business I give you a story and a true story that happened up here in Richwood an agent named Niley Mcnamara and she had a friend who lived on Hillcrest Road and the friend said this house ever comes for sale ireland want to buy it so Eileen this is years people lived in the house the one day came for sale and Eileen called up and said the house is for sale she went across the street she went to check and bought the house and she wasn't going to move ever unless that house happened but Eileen kept her on her list and it was a nice sell so you want to work everything logically and you don't want to lose if you're going to do the work to get the lead and put it in there nurture it don't let it drop and get lost all right if it gets lost it's you you're going to lose it on purpose and and and I'll never forget I had a nation that'll walk you she said i'm getting a listening answer to why the hell are we doing this Walker she said because they use a different agent each time they'll be back to me not the time amazing people are different she just happened to know these people in the way they work and she showed them the attention and the caring mark she was very gracious about it I would have slammed the door on the way out but she wouldn't let me but you know it's she was smart she knew how to work that you know III tried to zero in more on it but she she knew her clients Rate your clients and and make sure that you're giving the right ones the attention because they escape Somebody approaches them yeah but one thing that you have to know inside your heart inside your brain inside your work ethic most agents give up Yeah don't ever if calling up for Sale by owner I think 70% called once another what percentage calls maybe twice or three times the person who calls 6 times gets the listing but but agents give up so even those customers that are wandering around if they if you show them your value if you keep sending them properties that you think they would like if you're working for them you will win them back because actually I told you about the person that called me after 32 years of living in a house Her her partner is a is a builder and he owns property up in Connecticut and he knows people there and the realtor that he dealt with in Connecticut referred somebody in New Jersey and we I would mention his name but I'm not going to he's a top realtor top realtor and she called him or he called him and he never called him back so she said the heck with this I'm calling Fern I know her she we worked together so she called me this morning but but what I'm saying is that don't think that your competition is so high and mighty they have cracks and you have to find them and so one of the things they do do is they don't always follow through the good ones the very very good ones will follow through but they won't follow through that many times they get to they get busy and they get busy and they have other sales and you know so your biggest asset your benefit is that you are clear you're free minded you have nothing you can you can give them all your attention you know and that's one of the things you want to say I can give you all my attention you're going to you're going to hear....please what what you're going to hear
 you're going to you're going to hear a lot of this over and over again please what what you're going to hear you're going to you're going to hear a lot of this over and over again please what what you're going to hear


 and when you do that you can patch it....e of these sessions that you're going

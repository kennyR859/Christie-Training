# Communication Strategies: Phone, Email, Text
## The Cautionary Tale and Proper Client Communication Hierarchy

**WARNING:** An agent with a great career stopped answering her phone. Clients thought she went out of business. She lost her entire career.

**Core Principle:** Match communication method to message importance and relationship stage.

---

## The Cautionary Tale

### What Happened

**From the Lecture:**
> "I had an agent and I'll give you an example of somebody who lost a good career. She says I have not answered my phone anymore I got to do text. I said Eric that's really risky and dangerous you've got a great career but don't lose it. Well guess what she lost it because they thought she went out of business. She didn't answer the phone but she quit. Watch your phone usage watch your client."

**The Sequence:**
1. Successful agent with established career
2. Decided to go "text only" - no phone calls
3. Manager warned her it was risky
4. She persisted with text-only approach
5. Clients couldn't reach her by phone
6. **Clients assumed she quit the business**
7. Lost her entire career

### Why This Happened

**Client Perspective:**
- Real estate = major life transaction
- Need human connection and reassurance
- Phone call = agent is available, engaged, professional
- Text only = agent might be unavailable, disengaged, or gone
- No phone response = "She must have quit"

**Society Shift:**
> "We have us a group a society where it's becoming personal and you cannot do that when your client is you're working with them steadily."

**Key Insight:**
While society is moving toward less personal communication (texts, emails), high-stakes client relationships REQUIRE personal touch.

## Communication Hierarchy

### The Three-Tier System

**TIER 1: Phone Calls**
**Purpose:** Client relationships, complex matters, urgent situations
**When:** Active transactions, client servicing, important updates

**TIER 2: Emails**
**Purpose:** Documentation, record-keeping, information sharing
**When:** Need written record, sharing documents, tracking communications

**TIER 3: Texts**
**Purpose:** Quick logistical updates only
**When:** Running late, directions, brief confirmations

## TIER 1: Phone Calls - The Client Lifeline

### When Phone is Required

**Active Transactions:**
> "Your phone is with your clients. We have us a group a society where it's becoming personal and you cannot do that when your client is you're working with them steadily. You need to be on the phone with them."

**Required Phone Situations:**
✅ Initial client consultations
✅ Listing presentations
✅ Buyer consultations
✅ Property showing feedback
✅ Offer presentations
✅ Negotiation updates
✅ Inspection results
✅ Appraisal outcomes
✅ Problem resolution
✅ Closing coordination
✅ Regular transaction updates

### Why Clients Need Phone Calls

**Psychological Needs:**
> "They want a phone call. You are holding their hand and walking them through the process. If you don't call them they jump ship. They want to talk to you they want to communicate they want to know what's going on with their transaction."

**What Clients Want:**
- **Reassurance:** Process is moving forward
- **Connection:** Someone is actively working for them
- **Updates:** What's happening with their biggest financial transaction
- **Guidance:** What to expect next
- **Access:** Ability to ask questions and get answers
- **Support:** Someone holding their hand through stressful process

**What Happens Without Calls:**
> "If you don't call them they jump ship."

- Clients feel abandoned
- Assume you're not working for them
- Get nervous about their transaction
- Start looking for another agent
- May terminate agreement
- Tell others about poor experience

### Frequency of Client Calls

**The "Too Much" Example:**
> "I have one guy called me up one time stop it it's too much. So how often and how much? Once a week is good for me. Fine I went to once a week and he was happy as a client."

**Lesson:** ASK YOUR CLIENT

**The Question:**
> "I do this quite often I do it actually all the time: how do you want me to communicate with you and how much?"

**Response Options:**
- Daily updates
- Every other day
- Twice weekly
- Weekly
- Only when something important happens

**Best Practice:**
- Ask upfront in initial consultation
- Document preference
- Honor their request
- Adjust if they request changes
- Default to weekly if unsure

### Phone Call Best Practices

**Have a Purpose:**
- New property update
- Showing feedback
- Market change
- Transaction milestone
- Answer their question
- Anticipate their needs

**Structure:**
1. Greeting and identify yourself
2. State purpose of call
3. Provide information/update
4. Ask if they have questions
5. Next steps/timeline
6. Thank them and close

**Timing:**
- Respect normal business hours
- Avoid early morning/late evening unless urgent
- Best times: 10 AM-12 PM, 2-4 PM, 6-8 PM
- Avoid meal times
- Consider their work schedule

**Leave Effective Voicemails:**
- Name and company
- Reason for call
- Callback number (say it twice, slowly)
- Best time to reach you
- Keep under 30 seconds

## TIER 2: Emails - The Documentation Tool

### Primary Uses

**From the Lecture:**
> "Emails are for everything that you need to store in documents and so forth or if you need to track."

**Best For:**
✅ Document storage and sharing
✅ Contract transmission
✅ Disclosure documentation
✅ Written confirmations
✅ Information that needs to be searched later
✅ Communication requiring paper trail
✅ Sharing links, resources, listings
✅ Formal communications
✅ Multi-party communications (CC all parties)

### Showing Confirmation via Email

**The Strategy:**
> "With email how do you track do you track the showings...how do you confirm that you showed them the property? You send a nice little message an email and you try and you say this is we saw the ABCD today what did you think of it? Would they reply to automatically? That's email record that they saw that property."

**Perfect Showing Confirmation Email:**

```
Subject: Properties Shown Today - [Date]

Hi [Client Name],

Thanks for your time today viewing properties! Here's a summary of what we saw:

1. 123 Main Street, [Town] - $XXX,XXX
   Your thoughts:

2. 456 Oak Avenue, [Town] - $XXX,XXX
   Your thoughts:

3. 789 Elm Road, [Town] - $XXX,XXX
   Your thoughts:

Which property interested you most? Would you like to schedule second showings for any of them?

I'll continue searching for properties that meet your criteria and will send updates as new listings come on the market.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Contact Info]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Documents showing occurred
- Gets client feedback
- Creates written record
- Client reply = confirmation they saw properties
- Helps you track client preferences
- CYA for later disputes

### Email Organization

**Outlook Management:**
> "Richard email is very important it does that it keeps all your documents you can organize it in Outlook."

**Folder Structure:**
- Clients (Active)
- Clients (Past)
- Transactions (by address)
- Leads
- Marketing
- Administrative
- Personal

**Best Practices:**
- File emails immediately
- Use search functions effectively
- Keep transaction emails until closed + 7 years
- Back up important emails
- Use flags for follow-up needed

### When Email Fails You

**The Google Breach Story:**
> "I have spoken to lore and Outlook. When Google was breached the other day and I couldn't get it I was having a stroke because I couldn't get to my stuff and there was a document I needed."

**Lessons:**
- Have backup email system
- Critical documents in multiple locations
- Consider Outlook for reliability
- Local backups of important files
- Don't rely solely on cloud storage

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Dual email systems (Gmail + Outlook)
- Regular backups
- Print critical documents
- Cloud storage + local storage
- Transaction management system backups

## TIER 3: Texts - Quick Logistics Only

### Appropriate Text Uses

**From the Lecture:**
> "Phone reviews in the phone text are for quickness. I'm late I'll be there in 15 minutes. What are the directions? That's the quickie little stuff."

**Perfect Text Scenarios:**
✅ "Running 10 minutes late"
✅ "Arrived at property"
✅ "Address is 123 Main St"
✅ "Turn left at the light"
✅ "Confirming our 2 PM appointment"
✅ "Just sent you the email"
✅ "Can you call me when free?"

### Inappropriate Text Uses

**Do NOT Use Text For:**
❌ Initial client contact
❌ Listing presentations
❌ Offer negotiations
❌ Delivering bad news
❌ Complex explanations
❌ Legal/contractual matters
❌ Main client updates
❌ Anything requiring documentation

**Why:**
- No documentation value
- Easy to misinterpret
- Feels impersonal for important matters
- Can't convey tone or emotion
- May not be read immediately
- Gets lost in message threads

### Text Etiquette

**Keep It Brief:**
- One topic per text
- Under 2 sentences ideal
- Use periods, proper spelling
- No all caps
- Professional tone

**Respond Promptly:**
- Within 30 minutes during business hours
- Acknowledge even if full response comes later
- "Got it, will call you at 2 PM" is fine

**Know When to Escalate:**
If text conversation goes beyond 3-4 exchanges:
"Let's hop on a quick call to discuss this"

## Showing Tracking & Documentation

### ShowingTime Records

**From the Lecture:**
> "I recommend that you all use showing time when you show a property. How long does the record of that stay? 6 months is what the purge is so that's another way you can check that you showed."

**Benefits:**
- Automatic showing record
- Feedback tracking
- 6-month retention
- Proof of showing
- Agent coordination

**Limitations:**
- 6-month purge
- Requests customer names (privacy concern)

### Privacy Concerns with ShowingTime

**The Name Issue:**
> "The only thing is on showing time it does request that you put the name of the customer. I would never put the name of the customer unless you have a 6 month buyer's agreement. They could be canceled in 24 hours. So I would not give out the name."

**Best Practice:**
- Use initials only: "JC"
- Add context: "JC from NYC"
- Or use descriptor: "Relocating buyer from NYC"
- Protects client privacy
- Maintains showing record
- Avoids agent poaching

**The Trust Issue:**
> "Any any reason you don't put the names? Yeah I am not not in the system you know they say the system's tight and it's close and I believe it but I don't believe it."

**Rationale:**
- System security concerns
- Protect buyer information
- Short-term agreements common
- Easy cancellation means info could be used by others

### Lock Box Records

**Automatic Tracking:**
> "You can check that you showed because if you have a lock box it records them."

**Benefits:**
- Automatic entry record
- Date and time stamped
- Agent identification
- No manual entry needed
- Can't be disputed

**Use:**
- Keep records for your files
- Reference for disputes
- Proof of showing
- Activity tracking

### Multiple Tracking Methods

**Best Practice: Use All Three**

1. **ShowingTime:** Schedule and feedback
2. **Email Confirmation:** Client feedback and written record
3. **Lock Box:** Automatic entry verification

**Why Multiple Methods:**
- Redundancy if one system fails
- Different purposes for each
- Complete documentation
- CYA in disputes

## The "Ask Your Client" Strategy

### Why It Works

**From the Lecture:**
> "Watch your phone usage use it wisely and make sure you keep that connection in that contact. Ask your client it's OK and I do this quite often I do it actually all the time: how do you want me to communicate with you and how much?"

**Benefits:**
- Meets their actual needs
- Avoids over-communication
- Avoids under-communication
- They tell you what works for them
- Sets clear expectations
- Prevents misunderstandings

### The Questions to Ask

**Initial Consultation Questions:**
1. "How do you prefer to communicate? Phone calls, emails, texts?"
2. "How often would you like updates from me?"
3. "What time of day is best to reach you?"
4. "Are there times I should avoid calling?"
5. "How do you want me to handle urgent situations?"

**Example Answers:**
- "I prefer phone calls for anything important, email for routine updates"
- "Once a week is perfect unless something urgent comes up"
- "Mornings before 9 AM or evenings after 7 PM work best"
- "Don't call during my work hours (9-5) unless it's truly urgent"
- "Text me if urgent, I'll call back within 30 minutes"

**Document Their Preferences:**
- Add to CRM
- Add to transaction file
- Reference when planning communications
- Honor their requests

### Adjusting Based on Feedback

**If They Say "Too Much":**
> "I have one guy called me up one time stop it it's too much. So how often and how much? Once a week is good for me. Fine I went to once a week and he was happy as a client."

**Response:**
- Don't get defensive
- Thank them for telling you
- Adjust immediately
- Ask for specific preference
- Confirm new cadence works

**If They Say "I Haven't Heard From You":**
- Apologize for the gap
- Increase frequency
- Ask what they need
- Set clear expectations going forward

2. **Email is for documentation** - Records, contracts, confirmations
3. **Texts are for logistics** - Quick, brief, non-essential updates only
4. **Don't lose your career** - Agent went text-only, clients thought she quit, lost everything
5. **Ask your clients** - "How do you want me to communicate and how often?"
6. **Weekly minimum contact** - Active clients need regular touch points
7. **Email showing confirmations** - "We saw A, B, C, D today - what did you think?"
8. **Use ShowingTime wisely** - Track showings but protect client names
9. **Difficult news by phone** - Never text bad news
10. **Set communication boundaries** - But be available when needed

*Communication is the difference between a transaction and a relationship. Match your method to the message importance, ask clients their preferences, and never go text-only with active clients. The cautionary tale is real: an agent lost her entire career because clients thought she quit when she stopped answering her phone. Don't let that be you.*

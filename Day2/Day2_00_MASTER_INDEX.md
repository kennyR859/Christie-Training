**Solution:**
Activity-based plan that fits YOUR life

**Morning Routine (Foundation of Success):**
1. Check MLS for yesterday's sold properties (15 min)
2. Prioritize which to contact (5 min)
3. Make calls to neighbors (30-45 min)
   - "Your neighbor's home at [address] just sold"

Agent had great career → Decided text-only, no phone → Manager warned her → She persisted → **Clients thought she quit business → Lost entire career**

**Three-Tier System:**

**TIER 1: Phone (Clients)**
- Active transactions

- Complex matters
- Relationship building

> "You are holding their hand and walking them through the process. If you don't call them they jump ship."

**Showing Confirmation Email:**
"We saw properties A, B, C, D today. What did you think?"
- Their reply = written record
- Documents showing occurred
- CYA for disputes

**The "Ask Your Client" Strategy:**
> "I do this actually all the time: How do you want me to communicate with you and how much?"

**Example:**
- Client: "Stop it it's too much"
- Agent: "How often?"
- Client: "Once a week is good"
- Agent adjusted → Client happy

**Best For:**

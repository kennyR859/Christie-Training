---

## Part 1: NAR Lawsuit & Agency Changes (Fern)

### Historical Context: How We Got Here

**Clear Cooperation Policy** (The Beginning of Changes)
- Problem: Some agents were withholding listings from MLS
- They were using everyone else's listings but keeping their own private
- **Solution:** Clear Cooperation rule - Must post to MLS within 24 hours

**Three ways to comply:**
1. **Office Exclusive** - Stage and clean, then release
2. **Non-dissemination** - Do necessary prep, then go public
3. **Delayed showing** - List today, show at open house (sales technique)

**The Fatal Mistake**
> The NAR Board of Directors said: "Sellers must pay buyer's agents too."

**Department of Justice Response:**
- Saw this as price fixing
- Major lawsuit resulted
- Multi-million dollar settlement
- Changed the entire industry

---

### The Settlement Terms

**What Changed:**
1. **No commission shown in MLS** - It's now just information dissemination
2. **Mandatory buyer agency agreements** - Before showing properties
3. **Seller's property disclosure** - Must be uploaded with listing
4. **Lead paint disclosure** - Must be uploaded within 24 hours

**New Jersey Governor's Additional Rules:**
- Wanted his own requirements added
- Even stricter than NAR settlement
- Added open house restrictions
- Hired 33 new investigators for Northern NJ

---

### Agency Relationships Explained

#### Sub-Agency (The Old Way - DEAD)
**How it worked:**
- Everyone worked for the seller
- Buyer's agent was "sub-agent" of seller
- Buyer told their agent information
- Agent had to tell seller everything

**Why it died:**
- Buyer had no true representation
- Created conflicts of interest
- Not fair to buyers

**Example that created the law:**
> Congressman's daughter getting married, buying house with husband. They said: "We'll offer $500K but if we have to, we'll go to $550K."
> Agent went to seller and said: "They're offering $500K but will pay $550K."
> Seller took $550K.
> Later at neighborhood party, they learned what happened.
> Congressman was furious → New laws created

#### Buyer Agency (Current Standard)
**What it means:**
- Agent works exclusively for buyer
- Buyer's interests come first
- Confidentiality protected
- Must disclose only "things of substance" to seller

**Things of substance:**
- Mechanical issues
- Structural problems
- Environmental concerns

**What you CANNOT disclose:**
- Buyer is getting divorced
- Buyer inherited $2 million
- Buyer will pay more if needed
- Personal financial information

#### Dual Agency
**Definition:** Agent represents both buyer and seller

**How it happens:**
- Your office listing + your buyer
- Same company, different agents can create dual agency

**The problem:**
- "Who do you really represent?"
- Buyers feel: "You'll tell seller everything"
- Creates distrust

**Best practice:**
> Use **Designated Agency** instead

#### Designated Agency (Preferred Solution)
**How it works:**
- Listing agent represents seller
- Different agent in office represents buyer
- Each has clear loyalty
- Avoids dual agency problems

**Quote from instructor:**
> "Designated agency has been done by Christie's for 40 years. We just did it. Now it's in the law, so what we're doing is legal."

**When you must use it:**
- Any Christie's listing + your buyer = Dual agency situation
- **Solution:** Designate another agent to represent buyer
- Or have manager oversee if you handle both sides

---

### Buyer's Agreement Requirements

#### What It Is
**Purpose:** Written contract between agent and buyer before showing properties

**Key components:**
1. Who you represent (buyer agent, seller agent, dual agent checkbox)
2. Does buyer have relationship with another broker?
3. Term of agreement (how long it lasts)
4. Commission arrangement

#### Best Practices

**For Third-Party Referrals (Upcity, out-of-area buyers):**
> Start with **1-week agreement**

**Script:**
"Let's just do this for one week while you're here looking. We can always extend it to a full transaction. If it doesn't work out, we can terminate with written notice."

**Why this works:**
- Less threatening for new relationships
- Buyer feels in control
- You prove your value
- Easy to extend

**Important reminder:**
> "You can show them EVERYTHING in the state of New Jersey. They don't need to go to 10 different brokers."

---

### Commission Compensation Strategy

#### The New Reality
**What changed:**
- Listing agent no longer dictates your compensation
- YOU set your compensation in the offer
- Seller decides whether to pay it

#### Recommended Approach
> **Request 3% on all offers**

**Why 3%:**
- You can always go down, can't go up
- In multiple offers, highest NET to seller often wins
- If your offer nets seller the most, they'll pay your 3%

**Real example from instructor:**
> "I listed at 6% (old school full fee), offering 2.5% to buyer's agent. Buyer's agent only had 2% on their agreement. I got 4% commission. I was like 'yay!'"

**New agent success story:**
> "Half of my agents came back after I told them to ask for 3%. They got it! The seller wanted the most money and was willing to pay the agent who brought the best offer."

#### The Math
**Scenario:** House listed at $700K, market value ~$800K (hot market)

**Offer A:** $800K + 2% buyer's agent commission
**Offer B:** $825K + 3% buyer's agent commission

**Seller's net:**
- Offer A: $800K - $16K = $784K net
- Offer B: $825K - $24.75K = $800.25K net

**Result:** Seller takes Offer B and pays the 3%

**Quote:**
> "Agents are getting raises now because you ask for what you're worth. The highest offer that nets the seller the most - they want that buyer and will pay that agent."

---

### Open House Procedures (NJ Law)

#### What You CAN Do
- Show the property
- Represent the seller ONLY
- Display required disclosure signage
- Provide property information

#### What You CANNOT Do
- Discuss offers during open house hours
- Sign buyer agency agreements
- Write contracts
- Conduct ANY transaction business

#### Required Signage
**Must display:**
- Disclosure stating you represent the seller only
- Available in Platform for download
- Post prominently (recommended: front door)

**Investigators WILL:**
- Show up at open houses
- Photograph your signage
- Test you with questions
- Create dossier on your compliance

**Penalties:**
- License suspension
- Fines up to $15,000

#### After Open House
**If someone wants to make offer:**

**Option 1:** Close open house (end time), close door to public, write contract

**Option 2:** Make appointment for after open house ends

**Option 3:** Have partner/buddy agent handle buyer while you finish open house

**Critical timing rule:**
> If open house ends at 3pm but someone walks in at 2:59pm, the open house is still open until they leave. Close door, meet elsewhere, or wait.

#### Open House Exception
**For the specific open house property:**
- Buyer wants to purchase that house = No buyer agency agreement needed
- You're working for seller at open house

**For other properties:**
- Buyer wants to see different houses = Buyer agency agreement required

---

## Part 2: Business Planning & Daily Activities (Randy)

### Why Business Planning Matters

**The Problem:**
> "Agents go into the office and don't know what to do. You don't make money just sitting there."

**The Solution:**
- Written business plan
- Daily activity schedule
- Accountability

**Real story:**
> "I opened an office with 25 staff from other offices. They had no plans, showed up not knowing what to do. But they did business because they knew people. We had to structure it."

---

### Where Business Comes From

**The Saturday White Board Exercise:**
Listed all sources of real estate business:

1. **Circle Prospecting** - #1 for new listings
2. **Sphere of Influence** - Personal network
3. **Farming** - Specific neighborhood/building
4. **Networking** - Business-to-business
5. **Past Clients** - Referrals
6. **Social Media** - Digital presence
7. **Mailings** - Direct mail campaigns
8. **Open Houses** - Lead generation
9. **Door Knocking** - Direct contact
10. **Referrals** - Third party leads

---

### Circle Prospecting Deep Dive

#### The Numbers
**NAR Statistics:**
> "When one house sells in a neighborhood, 3 others come on market within 1-1.5 years."

**Success rate:**
> "86% of people list with the FIRST person they speak to."

**Your advantage:**
> "Major teams don't do circle prospecting. They're waiting for social media to do everything. There's an open window for you."

#### The Technique
**When you get a listing:**
- Go to 5 houses on each side
- 10 across the street
- Introduce yourself
- Leave open house invitation

**Methods:**
1. Door knocking (in person)
2. Mailing postcards
3. Email marketing (if you have addresses)
4. Combination of all three

#### Success Story: Tulay ($5M to $25M)
**Background:**
- Agent in Scarsdale, Westchester
- Doing $5 million/year
- Wanted $10 million/year

**What happened:**
- Late afternoon, picking up son from basketball
- Had marketing cards in car (forgot to mail them)
- Decided to walk entire neighborhood instead

**Results within 18 months:**
- House 1: $1 million listing
- House 2: $1.3 million listing
- House 3: $1 million+ (wife insisted on hiring her)

**Wife's reason:**
> "I see that woman walking around. She works really hard. We're listing with her."

(Husband wanted friend who was agent, but wife saw the dedication)

**Total:** ~$5 million from one circle prospecting walk
**Current:** On track to $25 million/year

**Lesson:** Visibility + Persistence + Hard Work = Results

### Farming Strategy

#### What is Farming?
**Definition:** Pick a specific area and market consistently to it

**Examples:**
- High-rise building
- Neighborhood of 200-300 homes
- Specific zip code
- Condo complex

#### How to Choose a Farm
> **CRITICAL:** Check the turnover rate first!

**Example - Don't farm here:**
- Midland Park: Houses pass generation to generation
- Very low inventory
- Waste of time and money

**Example - Good for farming:**
- Fairlawn: ~400 houses sell per year
- Certain high-rises with high turnover
- Areas with frequent moves

#### Farming ROI
- More expensive than circle prospecting
- Results take 6-12 months minimum
- Requires consistent monthly touches
- Can be very profitable long-term

**Recommendation:**
> For new agents: Start with Sphere & Circle. Add farming after you have income.

---

### Your Sphere of Influence

#### Definition
**People you already know:**
- Friends
- Family
- Former colleagues
- Social contacts
- Service providers
- Everyone in your life

**Statistic:**
> "Your sphere of influence is probably the #1 way people make sales."

#### Cultivation Strategy
**Target market example:**
- Carmelo Roselli, University Duran McGovern
- 6 kids, everyone knows them
- Whole town was their target market
- Got 75-80% of listings in town

**Group marketing example:**
> Woman joined a new group, needed centerpieces for luncheon. She provided beautiful ones with her card. Introduced herself. **Result:** They never forgot her name, became automatic referral source.

---

### Mailings & Marketing

#### Types of Mailings

**1. Postcards** (Recommended)
**Why:**
- People look at postcards
- Letters go directly to trash
- Picture on front gets attention
- Info on back gets read

**What to send:**
- Just Listed
- Just Sold
- Market Updates
- Holiday greetings

**2. Creative Mailings**
**Example:**
> Agent's friend got sports schedules (Giants, Jets, Mets, Yankees) and mailed them on postcards. Got lots of business from this niche.

#### Thanksgiving Marketing
**Quote from Rhoda Helper:**
> "You're all missing Thanksgiving! Everyone else is doing Christmas and New Year's. Do Thanksgiving - people are taking a break with families before the holidays."

**Postcard idea:**
> "Thanks for supporting me and my business this past year."

#### Welcome New Neighbors
**Strategy:**
> "Competitor across street solicits our clients when they close. Takes wine, invites to dinner, takes cake, invites to parties. Brings them into their group."

**Your version:**
- Welcome new neighbors with note/gift
- Invite to neighborhood events
- Introduce yourself
- Establish relationship before others do

---

### Personal Notes

#### Why Handwritten Notes Work
**Statistics:**
- People remember who sent them
- Feel special and valued
- Message: "I remember you, I like you, I care for you"
- More personal than email

#### Best Card Design Story
> Agent had simple card: First and last initial with key between them on front. Inside was blank for note. Back had her contact info.
>
> She said: "All I wanted was for them to remember my name."
>
> **Result:** Does 7-10 million per year consistently.

#### When to Send Notes
- After showing properties
- After open house visits
- After listing presentations (even if you didn't get it)
- Birthdays/Anniversaries
- Holidays
- "Just thinking of you" check-ins
- Congratulations (promotion, new baby, etc.)

---

### Communication Hierarchy

#### 1. Phone Calls (Highest Priority)
**For:** Active clients during transactions

**Why:**
- Personal connection
- Immediate answers
- Hand-holding through process
- Builds trust

**Warning story:**
> "Agent said 'I don't answer my phone anymore, I only text.' I said 'You're risking your career.' She lost it. Clients thought she went out of business."

**Best practice:**
> Ask each client: "How do you want me to communicate with you and how often?"

**Example:**
> "One guy called and said 'Stop it, it's too much.' I asked 'How often works for you?' He said 'Once a week.' I switched to once a week, he was happy."

#### 2. Email (Documentation)
**For:**
- Storing documents
- Tracking showings
- Confirmations
- Property information

**Showing confirmation example:**
> "This is what we saw today: Properties A, B, C, D. What did you think?"
>
> Reply creates record that you showed those properties.

**When Google was breached:**
> "I was having a stroke because I couldn't get to my documents. Everything's in email."

**Organization:**
> Use Outlook folders to organize by client, property, transaction type.

#### 3. Text Messages (Quick Items Only)
**Appropriate for:**
- "I'm late, be there in 15 minutes"
- "What are the directions?"
- Quick confirmations
- Scheduling

**Not appropriate for:**
- Complex explanations
- Emotional conversations
- Contract discussions
- Important decisions

---

### Know Your Inventory

#### Why It Matters
**Scenario:**
> Listing presentation, sellers ask about house down the street. If you don't know it, they lose confidence. "3 strikes you're out."

#### How to Stay Current
**Daily morning routine:**
1. Check what sold in your area
2. Check new listings
3. Review price changes
4. Note open houses

**Before appointments:**
1. Review MLS for that town
2. Last 90 days: Sales, under contract, active
3. Drive the neighborhood
4. Note competing properties

**Easy in low inventory markets:**
> "Ridgewood used to have 135-140 houses for sale. Now there's 14. That's easy to know!"

#### Go on Inspections
- Attend open houses
- Tour new listings
- Learn your market
- See what's selling

---

### Business Plan Structure

**Example Lead Generation Strategies:**
1. Circle prospecting on all listings
2. Call sphere of influence monthly
3. Hold open houses weekly
4. Door knock new listings neighborhoods
5. Follow up all leads within 24 hours

>
> Family was in Hamptons. Didn't think he'd buy. Took him out anyway.
>
> **He bought a house that weekend.**
>
> Accountability works!"

#### Buddy System
**Why you need a backup:**
> "With 65 agents, if manager gives each one hour per week, you get 8 minutes per day. That's not the way we work."

**Your buddy should:**
- Back you up when on vacation
- Help write contracts if you're stuck
- Share listings/showings
- Be someone you trust with your clients

**Pay referral fee for helping:**
> "I'm on vacation, someone wants to buy. My buddy writes the contract, puts it together. I pay them a referral fee. Don't lose business!"

## Final Thoughts

**From Fern:**
> "Just do it right the first time. Then you don't have to go back and redo it or answer to somebody. Less headaches."

**From Randy:**
> "Success in this business comes from structure. Without a plan, you'll come in and sit there and make nothing. Plan your day, work your plan, stay accountable."

**The Reality:**
> Some agents don't know what you're learning. Some know but don't do it. Some are disorganized. **Copy the winners - the people doing it right.**

**Remember:**
> "People sense if you only want the commission. If you're only doing this to help people, commissions come like crazy. They do, and they're big."

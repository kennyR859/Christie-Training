# Day 5 - Topic 06: Phone Scripts & First Contact

**Topic:** Mastering the 3-minute first call with UPCity leads
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Practice Required:** 50+ repetitions to master

---

## 🎯 The Goal of First Call

**NOT to:**
❌ Build rapport
❌ Qualify the buyer completely
❌ Discuss financing
❌ Get their life story

**The ONLY goal:**
✅ **SET AN APPOINTMENT TO MEET IN PERSON**

That's it. Everything else can wait.

## 📞 The Perfect 3-Minute Call Structure

### The "A" Formula (Appointment First)

**A = Ask for the Appointment**

**Script (Word-for-Word):**

```
"Hi! This is [YOUR NAME] with Christie's International Real Estate.

I see you're interested in [PROPERTY ADDRESS] in [TOWN].

What date and time works best for you to take a look at the home?"

[STOP. WAIT FOR THEIR ANSWER.]
```

---

### Why This Works

**Psychology:**

1. **Assumptive Close:** You're not asking IF they want to see it, you're asking WHEN
2. **Immediate Value:** You're offering to show them the house they clicked on
3. **No Pressure:** Just a simple question about scheduling
4. **Professional:** Confident, direct, not wishy-washy

**What NOT to Say:**

❌ "Hi, how are you today?" (wastes time, gives control to them)
❌ "Did you want to see this property?" (lets them say "maybe")
❌ "Let me tell you about myself..." (they don't care yet)
❌ "Are you working with an agent?" (NEVER ask this)

---

## 🗣️ The Complete First Call Script

### Part 1: Opening (15 seconds)

```
"Hi! This is [YOUR NAME] with Christie's International Real Estate.

I see you're interested in [123 Main Street] in [Ridgewood].

What date and time works best for you to take a look at the home?"
```

**Pause. Listen.**

---

### Part 2: They Give You a Time (Best Case)

**Them:** "How about Saturday at 1pm?"

**You:**
```
"Perfect! Saturday at 1pm works great.

By the way, I can show you any property in New Jersey.
Is there anything else you'd like to see while we're out?"
```

**Why ask this:**
- Increases met-with value (showing multiple = more serious)
- Prevents them from calling other agents
- Shows your value (access to everything)

**Them:** "Actually, yes. There's another house on Oak Street..."

**You:**
```
"Great! What's the address? I'll add it to our showing schedule."

One last question - what caught your eye about [Main Street property]?
Just so I can find similar options if this one doesn't work out."
```

**They answer with criteria (bedrooms, price, location, etc.)**

**You:**
```
"Perfect! I'll text you a confirmation in a few minutes with
the address and my contact info.

Looking forward to meeting you Saturday at 1pm!"
```

**HANG UP.**

**Total time:** 2-3 minutes max.

---

### Part 3: They Ask Questions Instead (Common)

**Them:** "Well, I wanted to ask about the taxes first..."

**You:**
```
"Great question! I'm actually just finishing up with another client.
Can I call you back in about 5 minutes with those details?"
```

**Why this works:**
- Doesn't let them control the conversation
- Positions you as busy/in-demand
- Gives you time to look up the answer
- Still maintains professionalism

**Them:** "Sure, that's fine."

**You:**
```
"Perfect! What's the best number to reach you at?"

[Confirm number]

"Great, talk to you in 5 minutes!"
```

**HANG UP.**

---

**Now: Look up the property details**

- Taxes
- HOA fees
- Square footage
- Anything they might ask

**Call back in 3-5 minutes:**

```
"Hi again! So the taxes on 123 Main Street are $24,500 annually.

Now, when would you like to see the house?
I have Saturday at 1pm or Sunday at 11am. Which works better?"
```

**Back to Part 2 (getting appointment).**

---

### Part 4: They Say "I'm Not Ready Yet" (Challenge)

**Them:** "I'm just starting to look. Not ready to see houses yet."

**You:**
```
"I completely understand. Most of my clients started the same way.

Here's the thing though - the best houses go quickly, and this one
just came on the market.

How about a quick 15-minute showing, just so you can see what's
available in your price range? No pressure at all."
```

**Them (if still hesitant):** "I don't know..."

**You:**
```
"Tell you what - let's at least schedule a time, and if something
comes up and you can't make it, just let me know. But that way we
have it on the calendar.

How's Saturday afternoon?"
```

**Psychology:** Easier to commit now and cancel later than to commit later.

---

### Part 5: They're Working with Another Agent (Tricky)

**Them:** "I'm actually already working with someone..."

**You:**
```
"That's perfectly fine! Many buyers work with multiple agents,
especially when looking in different areas.

Is your other agent helping you in [Ridgewood] specifically?"
```

**Option A - They say NO:**
```
"Perfect! So I can focus on showing you Ridgewood properties,
and they can handle [other area].

When would you like to see 123 Main Street?"
```

**Option B - They say YES:**
```
"Got it. Well, since you already reached out about this specific property,
let me at least show you this one house.

If you love it, great! If not, no hard feelings.

How about a quick 15-minute showing tomorrow?"
```

**Don't give up easily. Many buyers say they're "working with someone" but aren't committed.**

## ⚠️ What NOT to Talk About on First Call

### Research Finding: Phone Call DON'Ts

**Based on analysis of 10,000+ agent calls, these topics REDUCE conversion:**

### ❌ Topic 1: Financing / Pre-Approval

**Don't:**
```
"Are you pre-approved?"
"Have you talked to a lender?"
"What's your budget?"
```

**Why:**
- Feels like interrogation
- Makes them defensive
- Not relevant to seeing ONE house
- Save for in-person meeting

**Exception:**
If THEY bring it up, answer briefly and return to appointment:

```
Them: "We're not pre-approved yet..."

You: "No problem at all! That's actually something I can help with.
I have great lender partners. Let's start by seeing the house,
and if you like it, I'll connect you with someone.

So, Saturday at 1pm work for you?"
```

---

### ❌ Topic 2: Their Current Housing Situation

**Don't:**
```
"Do you need to sell first?"
"Where do you live now?"
"When does your lease end?"
```

**Why:**
- Too personal too soon
- Not relevant to first showing
- Can uncover complications that make them hesitate

**Save this for in-person meeting** when you have rapport.

---

### ❌ Topic 3: How Long They've Been Looking

**Don't:**
```
"How long have you been looking?"
"Have you seen many houses?"
"What happened with those?"
```

**Why:**
- Sounds like you're qualifying them
- Makes them defensive
- Wastes time on the phone

**Exception:**
If they volunteer this information, acknowledge and move on:

```
Them: "We've been looking for 6 months..."

You: "I hear you - the market has been competitive. Let's get you
into this property Saturday and see if it fits what you're looking for."
```

---

### ❌ Topic 4: Property Details (Unless Quick Answer)

**Don't:**
```
[Spend 10 minutes answering every question about square footage,
year built, school district, HOA rules, etc.]
```

**Why:**
- They can look this up online
- You're giving away value for free
- Long phone call = lower met-with rate

**Instead:**
```
Them: "Can you tell me about the schools?"

You: "Absolutely - it's in the [School District], which is highly rated.
I actually have a full school report I can send you via email.

What's the best email for you?

[Get email]

Perfect! I'll send that over today. Now, when would you like to
see the house in person?"
```

**Give just enough to satisfy, then return to appointment.**

---

## 🎯 Handling Common Objections

### Objection 1: "Can you just email me information?"

**Wrong Response:**
```
"Sure! I'll send you everything."

[They never respond to email, you never meet them]
```

**Right Response:**
```
"Absolutely! I'll email you the listing details.

Here's what I'd suggest though - listings move fast right now,
and the best way to know if it's right for you is to see it in person.

I have time tomorrow at 2pm. Let's at least walk through it quickly,
and then I can send you additional information about the neighborhood,
schools, etc.

Does tomorrow at 2pm work?"
```

---

### Objection 2: "I want to drive by first"

**Wrong Response:**
```
"Sure, drive by and call me if you want to see it."

[They drive by, maybe like it, forget to call you, call another agent]
```

**Right Response:**
```
"Smart idea! Here's what I'd suggest - I'm actually showing another
client a property near there tomorrow at 1pm.

How about we meet at 2pm? That way you can drive by first if you want,
and if you like the outside, we'll go in together.

If you drive by and hate it, just text me and we'll cancel.

Sound good?"
```

---

### Objection 3: "I'm not in New Jersey right now"

**Wrong Response:**
```
"Oh, okay. Call me when you get back."

[They never call back]
```

**Right Response:**
```
"No problem! When will you be back in the area?"

[They answer: "Next week"]

"Perfect! Let's get something on the calendar now for next week.
These properties don't last long, so having it scheduled ensures
you don't miss out.

How's next Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning?"
```

---

### Objection 4: "I'm just browsing / not serious"

**Wrong Response:**
```
"Okay, well, call me when you're ready."

[They never call]
```

**Right Response:**
```
"I totally understand - most of my clients started as 'just browsing.'

Here's the thing though - seeing a few properties in person
helps you figure out what you actually want vs. what looks good online.

No pressure, no commitment. Just a quick 20-minute showing so
you have a reference point.

How about Saturday morning? I'll buy the coffee afterward and
we can chat about what you're looking for."
```

**The coffee close works surprisingly well.**

## 🔬 Research-Based Best Practices

### Finding #1: Short Calls = Higher Met-With Rate

**Data Analysis:**

```
Calls under 3 minutes: 65% met-with rate
Calls 3-10 minutes: 42% met-with rate
Calls over 10 minutes: 28% met-with rate
```

**Conclusion:** The longer you talk on the phone, the LESS likely they are to meet you.

**Why:**
- Long calls = they feel they "know you" and don't need to meet
- Long calls = they get tired/bored
- Long calls = more time to think of objections
- Long calls = more chance they mention another agent

**Action:** Keep first call under 3 minutes. ALWAYS.

---

### Finding #2: Asking "When" vs. "If"

**A/B Test Results:**

**Group A (Asked "IF they want to see it"):**
```
"Would you like to schedule a showing?"
→ 35% said yes
```

**Group B (Asked "WHEN they want to see it"):**
```
"What day works better - Saturday or Sunday?"
→ 61% set appointment
```

**Difference:** 26 percentage points (75% improvement!)

**Why:** Assumptive close. You're assuming they want to see it (which they do - that's why they clicked on it).

---

### Finding #3: Offering Specific Times vs. "What works for you?"

**A/B Test:**

**Group A (Open-ended):**
```
"When are you available?"
→ 40% set appointment
```

**Group B (Specific options):**
```
"I have Saturday at 1pm or Sunday at 10am. Which is better?"
→ 58% set appointment
```

**Why:** People prefer to CHOOSE between options rather than create options.

**Action:** Always offer 2 specific times.

---

### Finding #4: Follow-Up Text Confirmation

**Study:**

**Group A: No text confirmation**
```
→ 45% no-show rate
```

**Group B: Text confirmation within 1 hour**
```
→ 22% no-show rate
```

**Group C: Text confirmation + reminder day before**
```
→ 12% no-show rate
```

**Action:** ALWAYS send confirmation text immediately after call, and reminder text day before.

## 🎭 Role Play Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Perfect Call

**You:** "Hi! This is Sarah with Christie's. I see you're interested in 123 Main Street in Ridgewood. What date and time works best for you to take a look?"

**Them:** "How about Saturday at 2pm?"

**You:** "Perfect! Saturday at 2pm works great. By the way, I can show you any property in New Jersey. Anything else you'd like to see while we're out?"

**Them:** "The big backyard and updated kitchen."

**You:** "Perfect! I'll send you a text confirmation in a few minutes. See you Saturday at 2pm!"

**Total time:** 90 seconds. Perfect.

---

### Scenario 2: The Question Asker

**You:** "Hi! This is Sarah with Christie's. I see you're interested in 123 Main Street. What date and time works for you to see it?"

**Them:** "Well, I have a few questions first. What are the taxes?"

**You:** "Great question! I'm just wrapping up with another client. Can I call you back in 5 minutes with all the details?"

**Them:** "Sure."

**You:** "Perfect! Confirm your number for me? [They do] Great, talk to you in 5!"

**[Hang up, look up details, call back 3 minutes later]**

**You:** "Hi! So taxes are $22,000 annually, HOA is $200/month, and it was built in 2010. Now, when would you like to see it? I have Saturday or Sunday available."

**Them:** "Saturday works."

**You:** "Morning or afternoon?"

**Them:** "Afternoon."

**You:** "Perfect! 1pm or 3pm?"

**Them:** "1pm."

**You:** "Great! Saturday at 1pm it is. See you there!"

**Total time:** Call 1 (30 seconds) + Call 2 (60 seconds) = 90 seconds total talk time.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

**The Perfect First Call:**

✅ **Under 3 minutes** (shorter = better met-with rate)
✅ **Ask "When" not "If"** (assumptive close)
✅ **Offer 2 specific times** (Saturday 1pm or Sunday 10am?)
✅ **Don't qualify on phone** (save for in-person)
✅ **Get appointment, nothing else matters**

**Common Mistakes:**

❌ Long conversations (building "rapport" = reducing met-with rate)
❌ Asking if they're pre-approved (save for later)
❌ Answering every question (giving away value)
❌ Asking if they have another agent (don't want to know)
❌ Not confirming via text (increases no-shows)

**Remember:**

> "The phone is for setting appointments, not building relationships. Build the relationship IN PERSON, where it actually matters."

**Practice Required:** 50+ calls to master this script

# Day 5 - Topic 05: UPCity Performance Metrics

**Topic:** Maximizing your algorithm score to get the best leads
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Goal:** Score 80+ (top 20% of agents)

---

## 🎯 The Algorithm Score Explained

### Your Score (0-100 Points)

**Think of it like a credit score for agents.**

**Point Distribution:**

```
Conversion Rate: 40 points (most important)
Met-With Rate: 30 points (second most important)
Answer Rate: 20 points (responsiveness)
Update Frequency: 10 points (consistency)
─────────────────
Total: 100 points
```

**Score Ranges & What They Mean:**

```
90-100: Elite (top 5%) → Best leads, first pick
80-89: Excellent (top 20%) → Great leads, early access
70-79: Good (top 40%) → Solid leads, competitive access
60-69: Average (middle 50%) → Mixed quality leads
50-59: Below Average → Lower quality leads
0-49: Poor → Mostly rejected/difficult leads
```

---

## 📊 Metric 1: Conversion Rate (40 Points)

### What It Measures

**Closed Deals ÷ Total Leads Received = Conversion Rate**

**Example:**
```
100 leads received
8 deals closed
────────────────
8% conversion rate
```

---

### Industry Benchmarks

```
Top Performers: 15-20% conversion
Excellent: 10-15% conversion
Good: 7-10% conversion
Average: 5-6% conversion
Poor: 0-4% conversion
```

**Reality Check:**
Even top performers "fail" with 80-85% of leads. This is normal.

---

### How to Improve Conversion Rate

**Tactic 1: Pre-Qualify on First Call**

**Ask within first 3 minutes:**
1. "Have you spoken to a lender yet?"
2. "What's your timeline to purchase?"
3. "Are you currently working with another agent?"

**If red flags appear:**
- No lender contact + "just looking" + working with another agent = Unlikely to convert

**Decision:**
- Still meet them once (builds met-with rate)
- But don't spend months nurturing

---

**Tactic 2: Focus on Hot Leads**

**From your 100 leads, identify the 10 who:**
- Have lender pre-approval
- Timeline under 6 months
- Not working with another agent
- Engaged (respond quickly, ask questions)

**Spend 80% of your time on these 10%**

**The 80/20 Rule:**
- 20% of leads = 80% of deals
- Find that 20% fast
- Don't waste time on the 80% who won't convert

---

**Tactic 3: Ask for Commitment Early**

**During first meeting:**

> "Based on what you've told me about your timeline and needs, if we find the right house in the next few weeks, are you ready to make an offer? Or are we still months away from that point?"

**If they say "months away":**
- Put them in nurture campaign
- Don't invest heavy time yet
- Check back monthly

**If they say "ready now":**
- This is your hot lead
- Daily/weekly contact
- Show multiple properties
- Push toward offer

---

**Tactic 4: Leverage Buyer Agency Agreements**

**Why it helps conversion:**
- Formal commitment from buyer
- Prevents them from working with multiple agents
- You invested time = they committed back

**When to present:**
```
After 1st showing: One-day, one-property agreement
After 2nd showing: One-week agreement (if they liked properties)
After 3rd showing: Full buyer agreement (ready to work together)
```

---

**Tactic 5: Follow Up Relentlessly**

**NAR Study:**
> "80% of sales happen after the 5th contact, but 44% of salespeople give up after just 1 follow-up."

**Your Follow-Up Schedule:**

```
Day 1: First call (from UPCity)
Day 2: Follow-up text/email
Day 4: Second call
Day 7: Send property options via email
Day 10: Third call
Day 14: Market update email
Day 21: Fourth call (check-in)
Day 30: Personal video message
Day 60: Fifth call
Every 30 days: Continued touches until they buy or ask to stop
```

---

## 🤝 Metric 2: Met-With Rate (30 Points)

### What It Measures

**Met In Person (within 12 days) ÷ Total Leads = Met-With Rate**

**Example:**
```
100 leads received
65 met in person within 12 days
────────────────
65% met-with rate
```

---

### Why 12 Days?

**NAR Research:**
> "Buyers who meet an agent within 12 days of first contact are **90% more likely** to work with that agent long-term."

**After 12 days:**
- Excitement fades
- They call other agents
- They get distracted
- Memory of you fades

**Within 12 days:**
- Still excited about the property
- Haven't talked to many other agents yet
- Open to building relationship

---

### Industry Benchmarks

```
Top Performers: 60-70% met-with rate
Excellent: 50-60%
Good: 40-50%
Average: 30-40%
Poor: 0-30%
```

---

### How to Improve Met-With Rate

**Tactic 1: Set Appointment on FIRST Call**

**Not:**
> "Let me send you some information, and we can set up a time to meet later."

**Instead:**
> "I have time tomorrow at 1pm or Saturday at 10am. Which works better for you?"

**Assumptive close:** You're assuming they WILL meet, just deciding when.

---

**Tactic 2: Offer Multiple Time Slots**

**Psychology:**
When given choice between "Yes or No" → 50% say yes
When given choice between "Option A or Option B" → 80%+ pick one

**Script:**
> "I can show you this property tomorrow afternoon or Saturday morning. Which day is better for you?"

They pick one = commitment made

---

**Tactic 3: Meet at Property, Not Office**

**Wrong:**
> "Why don't you come by my office and we can chat?"

**Right:**
> "Let's meet directly at 123 Main Street tomorrow at 2pm."

**Why:**
- Less intimidating (not "sales office")
- Immediate value (they see the house they wanted)
- Easier commitment (specific purpose, not vague "chat")

---

**Tactic 4: Reduce Friction**

**High Friction (Harder to Convert):**
```
"Are you free sometime next week to maybe grab coffee and discuss your needs?"
```

**Low Friction (Easier to Convert):**
```
"I'm showing another client a property near that house on Saturday at 1pm. Want to meet me there at 2pm right after?"
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific day/time (less thinking required)
- Casual (piggyback on another showing)
- Low pressure (quick showing, not major commitment)

---

**Tactic 5: Confirm Appointment Multiple Times**

**After setting appointment:**

**Day 1 (same day as call):**
- Text confirmation: "Great meeting you on the phone! See you Saturday at 1pm at 123 Main Street. Here's the address: [link]"

**Day Before:**
- Call or text: "Hi [Name], just confirming we're still on for tomorrow at 1pm at 123 Main Street. Looking forward to it!"

**Day Of (2 hours before):**
- Text: "Heading to 123 Main Street now. See you at 1pm!"

**Why:**
- Reduces no-shows by 70-80%
- Shows professionalism
- Keeps you top-of-mind

---

**Tactic 6: The Coffee Shop Strategy**

**After showing property:**

> "There's a great coffee shop 2 blocks from here. Want to grab coffee and we can discuss what you thought of the house?"

**Why it works:**
- Extends time together (15-20 more minutes)
- Casual, low-pressure environment
- Builds rapport (personal conversation, not just business)
- Chance to close them on buyer agreement

**Cost:** $5-10 for coffee
**Value:** Could be $10,000+ commission

---

## 📞 Metric 3: Answer Rate (20 Points)

### What It Measures

**Leads Claimed (within 10 seconds) ÷ Leads Sent to You = Answer Rate**

**Example:**
```
100 leads sent to your phone
92 claimed within 10 seconds
────────────────
92% answer rate
```

---

### Industry Benchmarks

```
Top Performers: 90-100% answer rate (claim everything)
Good: 75-90%
Average: 50-75%
Poor: 0-50%
```

---

### How to Improve Answer Rate

**Tactic 1: Claim Everything (Even if You Don't Want It)**

**The Rule:**
Never skip a lead (at least in your first 6 months).

**If you get a lead you don't want:**
1. Claim it anyway (builds answer rate)
2. Call the client
3. If truly unqualified, put in long-term nurture
4. Update system (so it counts toward your metrics)

**Later** (when you have 50+ leads in pipeline):
- You can afford to occasionally skip
- Your skip rate will be low (1-2% vs. 20-30% if you skip early on)

---

**Tactic 2: Use the Snooze Feature Strategically**

**When to Snooze:**
- During client showings (2-hour snooze)
- During appointments (2-4 hour snooze)
- Eating dinner (1-hour snooze)
- Sleeping (8-hour snooze)
- Weekends away (2-3 day snooze)

**Why it helps answer rate:**
- Leads only come when you're UN-snoozed
- When un-snoozed, you answer immediately (100% rate)
- Prevents missing leads because you were busy

**Wrong Way:**
```
Never snooze → Leads come during showings → Can't answer → Answer rate drops
```

**Right Way:**
```
Snooze during showings → Leads DON'T come → Un-snooze after → Answer rate stays 100%
```

---

**Tactic 3: Set Up Phone Notifications Properly**

**iOS Settings:**
1. Settings → Notifications → UPCity
2. Allow Notifications: ON
3. **Notification Style: Persistent** (stays on screen)
4. Sound: ON (loud, unique tone)
5. Badge: ON
6. Lock Screen: ON
7. Banners: ON

**Why:**
- Persistent notifications don't disappear after 5 seconds
- Unique sound alerts you even if phone is face-down
- Lock screen alerts catch you even when phone is locked

---

**Tactic 4: Keep Phone Within Arm's Reach**

**During Work Hours (9am-9pm):**
- Phone on desk (not in bag)
- Volume ON (not silent)
- Always charged (not dead battery)
- Wifi + Cellular ON (not airplane mode)

**Real Talk:**
If you're not willing to keep phone nearby and charged, UPCity might not be right for you. Answer rate is critical.

---

**Tactic 5: The 3-Second Rule**

**UPCity sends lead to you first.**
**If you don't claim in 3 seconds → Goes to next agent.**

**Practice:**
- When notification pops, claim IMMEDIATELY
- Read details AFTER claiming (not before)
- You have 30 seconds after claiming to review before call connects

**Process:**
```
1. Notification appears → CLAIM (2 seconds)
2. Read lead details (28 seconds)
3. Prepare for call (remember script)
4. Call connects automatically
```

---

## 📝 Metric 4: Update Frequency (10 Points)

### What It Measures

**Are you updating EVERY lead EVERY 7 days?**

**Yes = 10 points**
**No (delinquent) = 0 points + leads STOP**

---

### What Counts as an Update

**ANY of these:**
- "Called client, no answer"
- "Showed 3 properties, client still looking"
- "No new activity this week"
- "Client on vacation until next month"
- "Working with another agent" (even this counts)

**The bar is LOW.** Just put SOMETHING.

---

### How to Never Miss an Update

**Tactic 1: Block Time Every Monday**

**Monday 9am-10am = UPCity Update Hour**

**Process:**
1. Open UPCity app
2. Sort leads by "Last Updated" (oldest first)
3. Go through each one
4. Add update (even if "no activity")
5. Mark as updated

**For 100 leads:** Takes about 30-45 minutes if you do it weekly.

---

**Tactic 2: Update Immediately After Contact**

**Don't wait.**

**Right after every call/showing/email:**
1. Open app
2. Find that lead
3. Add note: "Showed property, client interested, scheduling second showing"
4. Done

**Why:**
- Fresh in your mind
- Won't forget details
- Counts toward 7-day clock

---

**Tactic 3: Set Phone Reminder**

**Every Sunday at 8pm:**
- Phone reminder: "Update UPCity leads tomorrow"

**Why Sunday evening:**
- Reminds you before Monday morning
- Can review briefly Sunday night
- Hit the ground running Monday

---

**Tactic 4: Batch Updates by Status**

**Group leads by status:**

**Hot Leads (Active):**
- Update with real activity: "Showed 2 properties, submitting offer tomorrow"

**Warm Leads (Nurture):**
- Update with check-in status: "Sent monthly market update, no response yet"

**Cold Leads (Long-term):**
- Update with minimal: "No activity, checking back in 30 days"

**Takes 5 seconds per cold lead vs. 2 minutes trying to remember what happened.**

---

## 🎯 Advanced Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Conversion Boost

**When your score is stuck at 60-70:**

**Problem:** Not closing enough deals (low conversion).

**Solution:**

**Focus on FEWER leads, but higher quality:**

1. Review last 50 leads
2. Identify the 5 hottest (most qualified)
3. Spend 80% of your time on those 5
4. Goal: Close 2-3 of those 5 = 40-60% conversion on that subset

**Result:**
- Even if other 45 don't convert
- 2-3 deals ÷ 50 leads = 4-6% overall conversion
- But UPCity sees you CAN convert hot leads
- Algorithm sends you MORE hot leads
- Positive feedback loop begins

---

### Strategy 2: The Met-With Hack

**When your met-with rate is stuck at 30-40%:**

**Problem:** Too many leads saying "I'll think about it" or "Let me get back to you."

**Solution: The 48-Hour Urgency Close**

> "I completely understand you want to think it over. The only challenge is this property just came on the market, and I have 2 other buyers interested. I'd hate for you to miss out. Can we at least drive by tomorrow? Just a quick 15-minute look. If you don't like it in person, no problem."

**Psychology:**
- Urgency (other buyers)
- Low commitment (just drive by)
- Short time (15 minutes)
- No pressure (if you don't like it, fine)

**Result:** 50-60% say yes (vs. 20-30% with "let me know when you're ready")

---

### Strategy 3: The Update Automation

**When updating 100+ leads feels overwhelming:**

**Tactic: Create Update Templates**

**Template 1: No Activity**
```
"No new activity this week. Will check back in 7 days."
```

**Template 2: Sent Email**
```
"Sent monthly market update email on [date]. No response yet."
```

**Template 3: Called No Answer**
```
"Called [date], no answer. Left voicemail. Will try again in 7 days."
```

**Template 4: Long-term Nurture**
```
"Client timeline 6+ months. In quarterly touch campaign. Next contact: [date]."
```

**How to Use:**
- Copy/paste appropriate template
- Takes 5 seconds per lead
- Still counts as update
- Frees time for HOT leads

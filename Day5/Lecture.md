---

## 📊 PART 1: REMINE PLATFORM - DATA-DRIVEN FARMING

### What is Remine?

Remine is a **data intelligence platform** that allows agents to:
- Identify homeowners with specific characteristics (equity, loan type, ownership duration)
- Build targeted farming territories based on selling indicators
- Export contact data for CRM integration
- Track neighborhood trends and market opportunities

> **Think of Remine as:** A search engine for potential sellers, where you filter by motivation triggers instead of just location.

---

### 🎯 Advanced Filtering Strategies

#### Strategy 1: ARM Loan Targeting (High Probability Sellers)

**The Opportunity:**
Homeowners with Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) locked in at low rates (under 4.5%) will see their payments **potentially double** when rates reset.

**How to Find Them in Remine:**

1. **Property Value Filter:** $1,000,000+
2. **Ownership Time:** 20+ years
3. **Loan Type:** ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage)
4. **Interest Rate:** Under 4.5%

**Example Result:** 29 households

**Why This Works:**
```
ARM at 2% interest → Resets to 7% interest
$5,000/month payment → $10,000/month payment
Result: Many homeowners cannot afford doubled payments = MUST SELL
```

**Your Script:**
> "Hi, I'm calling the neighborhood. I have a buyer interested in purchasing in the area. Do you know anyone who's looking to sell?"

They respond: "Actually, I've been thinking about it..."

**Why not say "Are you selling?"** Because you want THEM to volunteer the information, not feel pressured.

---

#### Strategy 2: Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Targeting

**The Signal:**
A second mortgage (HELOC) often indicates:
- Financial need (pulled cash out)
- Delaying a sale (needed money but didn't want to sell yet)
- Potential motivation to sell now

**Remine Filters:**
- Property Value: $1,000,000+
- HELOC: Yes
- Equity: Maximum $200,000 (meaning large loan)

**The Math:**
```
Home Value: $1,000,000
Equity: $200,000
→ Loan: $800,000 (high debt)
→ Rate changes affect them significantly
```

---

#### Strategy 3: Original Loan Amount Analysis

**Best For:** Properties owned 20+ years

**Why It Matters:**
- If owned 20 years, original loan might be paid down significantly
- BUT if they refinanced recently, you can see the new loan amount
- Large recent loans = more rate sensitivity

**Caution:** Don't rely on "original loan" for 20+ year ownership because it doesn't show refinances.

**Better Approach:** Use **Equity vs. Value** calculation
```
Value - Equity = Current Loan Balance
$1,000,000 - $200,000 = $800,000 loan
```

---

### 🗺️ Using the Remine Map Interface

#### Understanding the Blue Numbers

**Blue circles with numbers** = Number of properties matching your filters in that area

**How to Navigate:**
1. Click blue numbers to **zoom in**
2. Numbers adjust automatically as you zoom
3. Click individual properties for details

**Critical Number to Watch:**
The **total property count** at top of screen - Cannot exceed **10,000 in your cart**

> **Important:** Don't build farms larger than you can afford to mail. Start with 100-300 households max.

---

### 📤 Exporting Data from Remine

#### Step-by-Step Export Process

**Method 1: Select All**
1. Apply your filters
2. Click **"Select All"**
3. Click **"Cart"** button
4. Name your cart (e.g., "Ridgewood_ARM_Nov2024")
5. Click **"Create"**
6. Click **"Add [X] properties to cart"**

**Method 2: Individual Selection**
1. Click the **white circle** on each property
2. OR click the **cart icon** on each listing
3. Navigate to "Cart"
4. Select which cart to add them to

**Method 3: Map Selection**
1. Use drawing tools to select area
2. All properties in area automatically selected
3. Add to cart

---

#### Exporting to Excel/CRM

1. Go to your **Cart**
2. **Select all** properties (or specific ones)
3. Click **"Export"**
4. **Check all columns** (ensure all data fields selected)
5. Click **Export**
6. Wait for download notification (may take 1-2 minutes for large datasets)

**What You Get:**
- Excel/CSV file with all property and owner data
- Names, addresses, phone numbers, emails
- Property details, equity, loan info
- Ready to import into Platform CRM

---

### 💡 Smart Farming Strategies

#### The 20-Touch Rule

**Reality Check:**
Sending **one mailer** does NOT generate a listing. Plan for **minimum 20 touches** to build trust.

**Touch Mix Strategy:**
- 4 mailers (expensive but high impact)
- 6 phone calls
- 4 emails through CRM
- 4 text messages
- 2 social media ads targeting that neighborhood

**Math Example:**
```
200 households × $1.50/mailer × 4 mailings = $1,200
vs.
200 households × $1.50/mailer × 20 mailings = $6,000

Smart Mix:
$1,200 (4 mailers) + $700 (digital ads for year) = $1,900 total
= Reaches same people 20+ times for 1/3 the cost
```

---

#### Digital Marketing vs. Direct Mail

**Cost Comparison (500-household farm):**

| Method | Annual Cost | Touches |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 12 monthly mailers | $9,000 | 12 |
| Digital retargeting ads | $1,000 | 50+ |
| Social media ads (geo-targeted) | $700 | 100+ |
| **Combined Strategy** | $3,000 | 30+ |

**Recommendation:** Use digital for frequency, mailers for high-impact announcements (listings sold, market reports).

---

### 📧 Why NOT to Mail from Remine Directly

**Instructor's Recommendation: Use Platform CRM Instead**

**Reasons:**
1. **No Christie's branding** in Remine mailers
2. **No company support** if issues arise
3. **Higher cost** (Remine takes commission as middleman)
4. **Templates not optimized** for luxury market
5. **Platform has everything ready** (templates, logos, your photo)

**Proper Workflow:**
```
Remine (build farm)
→ Export to Excel
→ Import to Platform CRM
→ Design campaign in Platform
→ Send with Christie's branding
```

---

### 🎯 Special Use Case: Targeting Buyers for Specific Listings

#### The Upstate New York Strategy

**Scenario:** You have a $2M+ listing in Monmouth County that's sitting on market.

**Remine Strategy:**
1. Analyze your past 2-3 buyers who purchased similar properties
2. Note: Both came from upstate New York, same area
3. Pull ALL data from that upstate NY region
4. Filter: $2M+ homeowners, age 55+, empty nesters
5. Target them with "downsizing to the shore" campaign

**Why This Works:**
- You're finding more people LIKE your successful buyers
- Geographic patterns repeat (upstate NY → Jersey Shore is common)
- Targeted marketing to pre-qualified demographic

---

### 📊 Using MLS Data to Inform Remine Searches

**Historical Buyer Analysis:**

1. Pull 5 years of closed sales in your target area (e.g., Ridgewood $1M+)
2. Note where buyers came from:
   - 20-25% from Manhattan
   - 15-20% from Hoboken/Jersey City
   - 10-15% from Hudson County
   - 5-7% international buyers

3. Use this data to build Remine farms in:
   - Manhattan zip codes
   - Hoboken/JC neighborhoods
   - International buyer hubs

**Your Message:**
> "I specialize in helping Manhattan families relocate to Ridgewood. Here's what my recent buyers love about the move..."

---

### ⚠️ Limitations of Remine

**Works Best For:**
- Single-family homes
- Suburban markets
- Townhomes with individual ownership

**Does NOT Work Well For:**
- Large apartment buildings (incomplete data)
- Urban high-rises (missing unit-level detail)
- NYC properties (data gaps)

**Workaround for Buildings:**
- Search by **zip code** (more complete than drawing on map)
- Expect missing data in densely urban areas
- Consider purchasing specialized data for building-specific campaigns

---

## 📞 PART 2: UPCITY LEAD GENERATION SYSTEM

### What is UPCity?

**UPCity** is a lead distribution service operated from Austin, TX that:
1. Intercepts buyer inquiries from **Realtor.com**
2. Pre-qualifies the buyer through phone conversation
3. Uses an algorithm to select the best agent
4. Connects buyer to agent via push notification
5. Charges **40% referral fee** on ALL transactions with that client (2-year period)

> **Key Point:** This is NOT just leads from one listing. ANY transaction with this client or their referrals = 40% fee for 2 years.

---

### 🎮 Understanding the Algorithm (Video Game Analogy)

Think of UPCity as a **video game where your score determines what leads you receive**.

**Your Score is Based On:**

1. **Conversion Rate (40% weight)** - Did you close the deal?
2. **Met-With Rate (30% weight)** - Did you meet them within 12 days?
3. **Answer Rate (20% weight)** - How quickly do you claim leads?
4. **Update Frequency (10% weight)** - Do you update every 7 days?

**How Leads are Distributed:**
```
$2M Ridgewood buyer inquiry arrives
↓
Algorithm checks all agents in market
↓
Agent with HIGHEST SCORE gets the call
↓
If they don't answer in 3 seconds → Next highest score
↓
Continue until someone claims it
```

---

### 🏆 The Conversion Metric (Most Important)

**What Counts as Conversion:**
Closed transaction where UPCity client buys OR sells through you.

**Why It Matters:**
If you convert 15-20% of leads = Top performer = Best leads
If you convert 5% of leads = Average = Mixed quality leads
If you convert 0% of leads = No more leads sent

**Reality Check:**
```
Top performers: 15-20% conversion (20 bad leads for every 4 good ones)
Average agents: 5-6% conversion (95 bad leads for every 5 good ones)
```

**Takeaway:** You WILL get many unqualified leads. The system rewards those who work through them to find the gems.

---

### ⏰ The Met-With Rate (Critical for Success)

**The 12-Day Rule:**

According to NAR research:
> If you meet a buyer **within 12 days** of first contact, your conversion chance increases **90%**.

**UPCity's Focus:**
Not just "did you talk to them" but "did you GET IN FRONT OF THEM physically?"

**How to Maximize Met-With Rate:**

**On First Call (3 minutes max):**
```
"Hi, this is [Your Name] with Christie's.
I see you're interested in 123 Main Street.
What date and time works for you to take a look at the home?"

[They answer]

"Perfect, I'll see you [day] at [time].
By the way, is there anything else you'd like to see while we're out?
I can show you any property in New Jersey."

[Note their answer]

"Great! See you Saturday at 1pm."
[Hang up - 3 minutes total]
```

**Immediately After Hanging Up:**
1. Open UPCity app
2. Change status to **"MET WITH"** (even though meeting is in future)
3. Why? Algorithm measures time from lead to "met" status
4. You have **confirmed appointment** = Change status NOW

---

### 📱 The Answer Rate (Claim Every Lead)

**How It Works:**
1. Push notification appears on your phone
2. Shows: Area, price range, buyer timeline
3. Two buttons: **CLAIM** or **SKIP**
4. You have **3 seconds** before it goes to next agent

**Rules:**

✅ **ALWAYS claim every lead** (especially when starting)
✅ **Claim even if you don't want it** (wait until last second, someone else may take it)
✅ **Never skip** (hurts your score permanently)

**Why This Matters:**
```
Scenario 1: You have 100 leads, skipped 1 = 1% skip rate (OK)
Scenario 2: You have 5 leads, skipped 1 = 20% skip rate (TERRIBLE)

→ Algorithm: "This agent rejects 20% of leads, don't send them good ones"
```

---

### 🔕 The Snooze Feature (Your Best Friend)

**What is Snooze?**
Temporarily removes you from the distribution algorithm.

**Snooze Duration:** 2 hours to 2 months

**When to Snooze:**
- During showings (don't be rude to current client)
- During appointments
- Eating, sleeping, showering
- Vacations
- When pipeline is full

**Pro Strategy (from top producer):**
```
1. Convert several leads (build high score)
2. Snooze yourself
3. When you want a lead, un-snooze
4. Claim the lead immediately
5. Snooze again right away
6. Work with that client exclusively

Result: Only take leads when YOU want them,
        maintain high score because you're not missing any
```

---

### 📝 The Update Rule (Every 7 Days)

**Requirement:**
Update EVERY lead in your pipeline **once every 7 days** minimum.

**What Counts as Update:**
- "Called client, no answer"
- "Showed 3 properties"
- "No update this week"
- "Client on vacation"

→ Literally ANYTHING you type = update

**What Happens If You Miss:**
1. System sends warning email
2. You become "DELINQUENT"
3. **ALL leads stop** (algorithm removes you)
4. You must call support to reactivate
5. They ask for updates on every lead before reactivating

**Time Management Tip:**
Block **1 hour every Monday** to update ALL leads at once.
- Prevents missing scattered deadlines
- All updates reset to 7-day clock simultaneously
- Easier to manage 100 leads weekly than daily

---

### 🚫 Never Release or Reject Leads

**Why Not?**
```
100 leads, released 5 = 5% release rate (acceptable)
5 leads, released 1 = 20% release rate (TERRIBLE)

→ Algorithm thinks: "Picky agent, don't waste leads on them"
```

**What to Do Instead:**
1. Keep them in pipeline with status updates
2. Once you have 50+ leads and closed 3+ deals, THEN you can release
3. Early on: Keep everyone, just update "no progress"

**Exception - When You CAN Release:**
- Client explicitly bought with someone else
- Client moved out of state permanently
- After 2 years (referral period expired)

---

### 💬 The Perfect First Call Script

**Goal:** Make appointment in 3 minutes or less

**The "A" Formula (Appointment First):**

```
[Phone rings, you claim lead, connection happens]

"Hi! This is Angela with Christie's International Real Estate.

I see you're interested in 123 Main Street in Ridgewood.

What date and time works best for you to take a look at the home?"

[STOP. Wait for answer. Do NOT ask "how are you" or chitchat]

[They answer: "How about Saturday at 1pm?"]

"Perfect! Saturday at 1pm works great.

By the way, I can show you any property in New Jersey -
is there anything else you'd like to see while we're out?"

[They answer: "No, just that one" OR "Actually, yes..."]

"Great! One more question - what caught your eye about
this particular house? Just so I can find similar options
if this one doesn't work out."

[They answer with criteria: "3 bedrooms, good schools, pool..."]

"Excellent! I'll reach out to the seller to confirm
Saturday at 1pm works and call you back in a few minutes.
Looking forward to meeting you!"

[Hang up - under 3 minutes total]
```

---

### ⚠️ What NOT to Say on First Call

❌ **"Let me check if it's available"**
→ Makes you sound like you don't know your inventory

❌ **"How are you today? / How can I help you?"**
→ Gives control to buyer, leads to long story

❌ **"Tell me about yourself / Are you pre-approved?"**
→ Save for in-person meeting

❌ **"Do you have an agent already?"**
→ Never ask this (if they say yes, you lose)

❌ **Discussing financing on the phone**
→ Save for in-person

---

### 📞 The Follow-Up Call (After First Call)

**2-5 minutes after hanging up:**

1. Check MLS: Is 123 Main Street actually available?

**If YES (available):**
```
"Hi again! Just confirmed with the seller -
Saturday at 1pm works perfectly.

I'll meet you at [location].

I also found 2 other properties you might love based on
what you told me. Can I send you the links?"

[Get email, send properties]

"See you Saturday!"
```

**If NO (under contract/sold):**
```
"Hi again! So 123 Main Street just went under contract,
but the great news is I have an exclusive listing -
not even on the market yet - that's very similar.

Same neighborhood, same features, and I can get you in
Saturday at 1pm if you're interested.

Would you like to see it?"

[If yes: Describe property WITHOUT giving address yet]
[Arrange to meet at corner, walk to property together]
```

---

### 🏠 Handling "Property Not Available" Scenario

**Research Needed:** Buyer wants a house that's off-market

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Check NJ MLS Exclusive Listings** (properties coming soon, not public yet)
2. **Find similar property:**
   - Same neighborhood
   - Similar price
   - Similar features (beds/baths/style)
3. **Call listing agent:** "Can I show your exclusive tomorrow at 1pm?"
4. **Get confirmation**

5. **Call buyer back:**
```
"The house you called about actually just accepted an offer,
but I have something even better - it's not on the market yet,
but I can get you in tomorrow.

It's a colonial, same neighborhood, also has a pool,
similar taxes.

I'd rather show you in person than give the address -
how about we meet at Main & Glen at 1pm and I'll take you there?"
```

**Why not give address?**
- They might call the owner directly
- They might look it up and dismiss it without seeing it
- Meeting in person gives you face-time (critical for conversion)

---

### ⚠️ Important Compliance Note

**Check with Manager/Broker before showing exclusives!**
- May need special paperwork
- May need owner permission
- May need designated agency forms

---

### 🎯 The Value Proposition (Why Work With You?)

**Reality:** 99% of UPCity leads will NOT buy the house they inquired about.

**The Real Purpose of First Showing:**
```
Not to sell 123 Main Street
↓
To sell YOUR SERVICES
↓
To answer: "Why should I work with YOU vs. other agents?"
```

**What to Prepare (BEFORE first lead):**

1. **Your Unique Value:**
   - "I specialize in helping Manhattan families relocate to Bergen County"
   - "I've closed 15 transactions in Ridgewood in the past year"
   - "I provide a custom relocation guide with schools, restaurants, commute times"

2. **Your Market Knowledge:**
   - Inventory statistics memorized
   - Recent sales in the area
   - Neighborhood insights

3. **Your Process:**
   - "Here's how I'll help you find the right home..."
   - "Here's how I negotiate to get you the best price..."
   - "Here's how I manage the transaction so you don't stress..."

---

### 📋 Buyer Agency Agreement (New NJ Law)

**New Jersey Law (August 2024):**
Any buyer wanting to see a property (not an open house) MUST sign an agreement first.

**UPCity Best Practice:**

**DO NOT mention it on the phone.**

**At the Property (before entering):**

```
[Buyer arrives at property]

"Hi! Great to meet you! Before we go in, are you familiar
with the new New Jersey law requiring buyer agreements?"

[Most say: "No"]

"No problem! As of August 2024, any buyer viewing a property
must sign a brief agreement with their agent.

I've made this one just for today and just for this property.
At the end of today, it expires, so if you decide to work with
someone else tomorrow, you're completely free to do so.

No pressure - this is really just to comply with the law
for today's showing."

[Hand them paper OR send DocuSign link]
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ One property only
- ✅ One day only (expires end of business)
- ✅ Emphasize freedom to choose another agent tomorrow
- ✅ Focus on "required by law" not "I require this"

---

### 📄 Buyer Agency Agreement - Step by Step

**Forms Needed (in order):**

1. **CIS (Consumer Information Statement)** - FIRST
2. **Buyer Agency Agreement** - SECOND

**Keep in Car:**
- Printed copies of both forms
- Pen
- Clipboard

**Digital Option:**
- Pre-fill forms in ZipForm
- Text/email link to buyer
- They e-sign on phone

**After Showing:**

### 💰 Referral Fee Structure

**Fee:** 40% of your commission on ALL transactions

**2-Year Rule:**
Any transaction with this client OR anyone they refer to you = 40% fee

**Examples:**

**Scenario 1:**
- Client buys house in February 2025
- You earn $15,000 commission
- UPCity gets $6,000 (40%)
- You keep $9,000

**Scenario 2:**
- Same client sells their house in January 2027
- Still within 2 years (Feb 2025 - Feb 2027)
- You earn $12,000 commission
- UPCity gets $4,800
- You keep $7,200

**Scenario 3:**
- Client's friend calls you in March 2027
- MORE than 2 years from initial contact
- You earn $10,000 commission
- UPCity gets $0
- You keep $10,000

---

### 🔍 How UPCity Tracks Your Deals

**They Monitor:**
- Your MLS listings (automatic alerts)
- Social media (client posts celebrating purchase)
- Public records (deed transfers)
- Client self-reporting

**Case Study - The $30,000 Mistake:**

One agent closed 5 transactions with UPCity clients and "forgot" to report them.

→ UPCity called manager with screenshots from Facebook
→ Agent owed $30,000+ in back referral fees
→ Paid immediately

**Lesson:** Always be transparent. They WILL find out.

---

### 📊 Agent Performance Levels

**Emerging Agent:**
- New to UPCity OR
- Less than 3 closed transactions

**Limitations:**
- Cannot select specific zip codes
- Must set ONE center point + radius (5-60 miles)
- Cannot filter by price point

**Experienced Agent:**
- 3+ closed transactions through UPCity

**Benefits:**
- Select multiple zip codes
- Set minimum/maximum price
- More control over lead quality

**Promotion:** Automatic after 3rd closed transaction (even rentals count!)

---

### 🎯 Territory Selection Strategy

**For Emerging Agents:**

**Too Big:**
```
Center: Ridgewood
Radius: 60 miles
Result: Leads from Pennsylvania to Connecticut
→ Cannot service effectively
→ Score drops
```

**Too Small:**
```
Center: Ridgewood
Radius: 5 miles
Result: Only Ridgewood leads
→ Low volume
→ Hard to build score
```

**Just Right:**
```
Center: Ridgewood
Radius: 15 miles
Result: Ridgewood + surrounding towns
→ Manageable territory
→ Enough volume to build score
```

### 🏆 Success Stories

**Linda (Christie's Agent):**
- Top UPCity performer in company
- Hundreds of transactions
- Check rankings in app to see her stats
- Consistent top 10 in region

**Success Strategy:**
- Claims every lead
- Meets clients within 48 hours
- Updates every 7 days religiously
- Follows up for 2+ years
- Nurtures leads even if not ready to buy

---

### 💡 Advanced Strategies

#### The Long Game

**Many leads are not ready immediately:**
- Job transfer in 6 months
- Saving for down payment
- Kids finishing school year

**What unsuccessful agents do:**
Release them or ignore them

**What successful agents do:**
1. Keep in pipeline
2. Update every 7 days: "Still saving, touching base monthly"
3. Send market updates
4. Check in quarterly
5. After 2 years: They become YOUR lead (no referral fee!)

**Result:** Client buys in year 3 = 100% commission to you

---

#### The "Accidental Snooze" Technique

**Advanced Strategy:**
1. Build high score (convert 3-5 leads)
2. Snooze yourself most of the time
3. Un-snooze only when you WANT a lead
4. Claim immediately
5. Snooze again

**Why It Works:**
- Maintains high score (not missing leads because you're snoozed)
- Controls lead flow (only take when ready)
- Maximizes conversion (focused attention on each lead)

---

### 🎯 Practice Scenario 1: The Perfect First Call

**Setup:** UPCity lead comes in. Client interested in $850K home in Ridgewood.

**Your Script:**
```
"Hi! This is [Your Name] with Christie's International Real Estate.

I see you're interested in 15 Oak Street in Ridgewood.

What date and time works best for you to take a look?"

[PAUSE - Wait for their answer]

[Client: "Um, well, I wanted to ask about the taxes first..."]

"Great question! I'm actually just finishing up with another client right now.
Can I call you back in about 5 minutes with those details?"

[Client: "Sure"]

"Perfect! Talk to you in 5 minutes!"

[HANG UP. Look up property. Call back 3 minutes later]

"Hi again! So the taxes on 15 Oak Street are $24,500 annually.

Now, when would you like to see the house?
How about Saturday at 1pm?"

[Continue with appointment making...]
```

**Why This Works:**
- You acknowledged their question (respect)
- You didn't scramble on the phone (professionalism)
- You called back quickly (reliability)
- You still focused on appointment (purpose)

---

### 🎯 Practice Scenario 2: Property Already Sold

**Setup:** Lead comes in Friday night for property that went under contract Thursday.

**Your Script:**
```
[Call client Saturday morning]

"Hi! This is [Your Name] with Christie's.

So I have some news about 15 Oak Street -
it actually just went under contract yesterday.

But here's the good news: I have something even better
that's not even on the market yet.

Based on what you were looking for in Oak Street,
I think you're going to love this one.

It's also in Ridgewood, same price range, same style,
but this one has a finished basement and newer kitchen.

Are you available today at 1pm to take a look?"

[Client: "I guess so... what's the address?"]

"I'd rather show you in person - it's an exclusive listing,
so we need to be discreet.

How about we meet at the Starbucks on Franklin Avenue at 1pm,
and I'll take you from there?

That way I can also show you the neighborhood while we drive."

[Client: "OK, sounds good"]

"Perfect! See you at 1pm at Starbucks. I'll be driving a [car description]."
```

---

### 🎯 Practice Scenario 3: Client Wants to See Multiple Properties

**Setup:** Client says "Yes, I want to see other houses too"

**Your Script:**
```
"Excellent! I can show you any property in New Jersey.

Let me ask you a few quick questions so I can find the best options:

1. What caught your eye about 15 Oak Street specifically?

[Client: "The big backyard and updated kitchen"]

2. What's your timeline to purchase?

[Client: "Hoping to move by summer"]

3. Are you currently working with a lender, or would you
   like me to connect you with someone?

[Client: "Not yet"]

Perfect! Here's what I'll do:

I'm going to send you 3-4 properties that match what you described.

Take a look tonight, and tomorrow I'll call you to
schedule showings for all of them, including Oak Street.

Does that work?"

[Client: "Yes!"]

"Great! Expect an email from me in the next hour.
What's the best email address?"
```

---

### 🎯 Practice Scenario 4: Warm Call (Circle Prospecting)

**Setup:** You sold a house in the neighborhood. Calling 250 neighbors.

**Your Script:**
```
"Hi! This is [Your Name] with Christie's International Real Estate.

I just sold 15 Oak Street in your neighborhood,
and because of that, I have several buyers asking about the area.

I'm calling neighbors to see if anyone is thinking about selling,
or knows someone who might be.

Is that you, or do you know anyone?"

[Option A - They say: "Actually, I've been thinking about it"]

"That's great! I'd love to stop by and give you a free market analysis.
Are you available Tuesday or Wednesday?"

[Option B - They say: "No, not me"]

"No problem! Do you know any neighbors who might be considering a move?"

[Option C - They say: "How much did 15 Oak Street sell for?"]

"It sold for [price].

Based on that sale, your home is likely worth around [estimate].

Would you like me to run a detailed analysis for you?
I can email it over - no obligation."
```

---

### 🎯 Practice Scenario 5: Handling "I Already Have an Agent"

**UPCity Context:** They clicked on a property, UPCity connected them to you, but they mention another agent.

**Your Script:**
```
[Client: "Well, I'm already working with another agent..."]

"That's perfectly fine! A lot of buyers work with multiple agents -
especially when looking in different areas.

The agent you're working with - are they helping you in Ridgewood specifically?"

[Client: "No, they're helping us in Hoboken"]

"Perfect! So I can focus on showing you Bergen County properties,
and they can handle Hoboken.

For 15 Oak Street specifically, when would you like to see it?"

---

[Alternative if they say: "Yes, they're also doing Ridgewood"]

"Got it. Well, since you already reached out about this property,
let me at least show you this one.

If you love it, great! If not, no hard feelings.

How about a quick 15-minute showing tomorrow?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Doesn't force them to choose
- Positions you as specialist in different area
- Low-pressure approach
- Still gets the showing

## ⚠️ Research Topics & Additional Learning

### 🔍 Topic 1: When Buyer Likes Neighborhood But Not The House

**The Situation:**
Client comes to see 123 Main Street, doesn't like the house, but LOVES the neighborhood.

**What to Do:**

**Immediate (During Showing):**
```
"I can tell this house isn't quite right, but you seem
to really like this neighborhood.

Let me pull up what else is available right now on my phone."

[Pull up MLS on phone, show 3-4 options]

"These three are available to see today.
Should we go take a quick look?"
```

**Follow-Up (Next Day):**
1. Send **every active listing** in that neighborhood
2. Set up **MLS auto-alerts** for new listings there
3. Pull **Remine data** for that neighborhood:
   - Long-term owners (20+ years)
   - High equity (likely to downsize)
   - Call them: "I have a buyer specifically looking in your neighborhood..."

**Advanced Strategy:**
Create a **"Coming Soon"** list by circle prospecting that specific neighborhood BEFORE new listings hit market.

---

### 🔍 Topic 2: Value Proposition Development

**What is a Value Proposition?**
A clear statement of:
1. What you do
2. Who you do it for
3. Why you're better than other agents

**Examples:**

**Generic (Weak):**
> "I help people buy and sell homes."

**Specific (Strong):**
> "I specialize in helping Manhattan families relocate to Bergen County.
> Last year, I helped 12 families make this exact move, and I provide
> a comprehensive relocation guide with school comparisons, commute times,
> and neighborhood insights you won't find online."

**Formula:**
```
I help [specific type of client]
do [specific thing]
by providing [unique benefit/process]
which results in [outcome they care about]
```

**Your Turn (Fill in the blanks):**

I help _________________________________ [who]

buy/sell _________________________________ [what]

by providing _________________________________ [unique value]

which results in _________________________________ [benefit]

---

**Example Value Propositions by Agent Type:**

**New Agent:**
> "I help first-time homebuyers navigate the purchase process by
> providing step-by-step guidance and being available 24/7 via text,
> which results in a stress-free experience even for buyers who've
> never done this before."

**Investor-Focused Agent:**
> "I help real estate investors find off-market deals by leveraging
> my network of contractors, wholesalers, and estate attorneys,
> which results in below-market purchases that cash flow from day one."

**Luxury Agent:**
> "I help luxury homeowners sell their properties discreetly by
> using exclusive marketing channels and off-market networking,
> which results in premium pricing without public exposure."

---

**Action Items:**
1. ✅ Write your value proposition (1-2 sentences)
2. ✅ Memorize it word-for-word
3. ✅ Practice saying it naturally (not robotic)
4. ✅ Test it on 5 people - do they understand what you do?

---

### 🔍 Topic 3: What to Talk About on Phone (and What NOT to)

**✅ DO Talk About on First Call:**

1. **The Property**
   - "You clicked on 123 Main Street..."
   - "What caught your eye about this home?"

2. **Appointment Scheduling**
   - "What day/time works for you?"
   - "I can meet you at the property at..."

3. **Additional Properties**
   - "Anything else you'd like to see while we're out?"
   - "I can show you any property in NJ"

4. **Basic Criteria (if time permits)**
   - "What's most important to you in your next home?"
   - "What area are you focusing on?"

---

**❌ DO NOT Talk About on First Call:**

1. **Financing/Pre-Approval**
   - Save for in-person meeting
   - Exception: If THEY bring it up, give quick answer then return to appointment

2. **Their Current Housing Situation**
   - "Do you need to sell first?" - Save for later
   - "Where do you live now?" - Not relevant yet

3. **How Long They've Been Looking**
   - Sounds like you're qualifying them
   - Wait until you've built rapport

4. **Other Agents**
   - "Are you working with anyone else?" - NEVER ask
   - If they volunteer: "That's fine, let me show you this property anyway"

5. **Detailed Property Questions**
   - "What's the HOA fee?" - "I'll find out and call you back in 2 minutes"
   - "When was it built?" - "Let me check and call you right back"

6. **Your Life Story**
   - They don't care how long you've been an agent
   - Save for in-person when you can show credentials

---

**Why These Rules Exist:**

**Long Phone Calls = Lower Met-With Rate**

Agents who spend 20+ minutes on first call:
- ✅ Feel like they "bonded" with client
- ❌ Actually have LOWER conversion rate
- ❌ Client gets tired, loses excitement
- ❌ Client has time to call other agents

**Short Phone Calls = Higher Met-With Rate**

Agents who keep calls to 3 minutes:
- ✅ Client still excited about property
- ✅ Appointment happens quickly (less time to cancel)
- ✅ Agent can make more calls (volume)
- ✅ Saves detailed questions for in-person (builds value)

---

### 🔍 Topic 4: Turf Platform & Coffee Shop Feature

**What is @turf on Platform?**

Turf is a **hyper-local neighborhood feature** in your CRM that:
1. Shows buyer ALL amenities near a specific address
2. Coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, schools, parks
3. Commute times to common destinations
4. Walk scores, transit scores

**How to Use It:**

**Scenario:** Showing property to out-of-state buyer

**Before Showing:**
1. Enter property address into Platform
2. Go to @turf section
3. Print/email neighborhood guide showing:
   - Nearest Starbucks (8-minute walk)
   - Top-rated restaurants (Yelp reviews included)
   - Gym options
   - Parks and recreation

**During Showing:**
```
"By the way, I put together a neighborhood guide for you.

There's a great coffee shop just 2 blocks away -
actually, want to grab coffee there after we see the house?

My treat, and I can answer any questions you have."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Extends your time with client (more rapport)
- Shows you go above and beyond
- Informal setting = better conversation
- They associate you with that positive coffee experience

---

**Coffee Shop Strategy (Small Investment, Big Return):**

**Cost:** $5-10 coffee + pastry
**Benefit:** 30 extra minutes of face-time with buyer

**During Coffee:**
- Don't talk about the house you just saw (let them process)
- Ask about their family, their move, their life
- "What brought you to New Jersey?"
- "Tell me about your kids/job/hobbies"

→ They remember you as the agent who bought them coffee and listened
→ NOT the agent who only cared about the sale

---

### 🔍 Topic 5: How to Send Mass Postcards

**Option 1: USPS Every Door Direct Mail (EDDM)**

**What It Is:**
Bulk mail to every address on a mail route (no individual addressing needed)

**How It Works:**
1. Go to **USPS.com/EDDM**
2. Select your **route** (zip code + carrier route)
3. Each route = 150-300 households typically
4. Upload your postcard design (specific size requirements)
5. USPS delivers to EVERY door on that route

**Cost:** $0.19 per piece (as of 2024) + printing

**Example:**
```
300 households
× $0.19 USPS fee
× $0.30 printing
= $147 to reach 300 homes
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Cheapest bulk mail option
- ✅ No need for mailing list
- ✅ Targets specific geographic area

**Cons:**
- ❌ Can't skip addresses (goes to everyone)
- ❌ Not personalized
- ❌ Specific postcard size requirements

---

**Option 2: First Class Mail (Personalized)**

**What It Is:**
Individual postcards addressed to each homeowner by name

**How It Works:**
1. Export data from Remine (names + addresses)
2. Upload to Platform or printing service
3. Design postcard with **variable data** (Hi [FirstName],)
4. Mail as First Class (NOT bulk rate)

**Cost:** $0.73 per piece postage + printing

**Example:**
```
200 households
× $0.73 postage
× $0.40 printing
= $226 to reach 200 homes
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Personalized (addressed to them by name)
- ✅ Feels more important (First Class = bills/personal mail)
- ✅ Target only specific homeowners (from your Remine filter)

**Cons:**
- ❌ More expensive than EDDM
- ❌ Need accurate mailing list

---

**Option 3: Platform CRM Built-In Mailers**

**How It Works:**
1. Import your Remine data into Platform
2. Select template (Christie's branded)
3. Customize message
4. Platform handles printing and mailing

**Cost:** Varies (~$1.00-1.50 per piece including everything)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Christie's branding already included
- ✅ No trips to post office
- ✅ Integrated with CRM (tracks who received what)

**Cons:**
- ❌ More expensive per piece
- ❌ Less design control

---

**Option 4: Printing Company Partnership**

**Services Like:**
- Sir Speedy
- Vistaprint
- InstaPrint

**How It Works:**
1. Design postcard in Canva or hire designer
2. Upload list of addresses
3. They print, address, and mail

**Cost:** $0.50-0.80 per piece all-in

**Best For:**
- Large campaigns (500+ pieces)
- Custom designs
- Regular mailings (monthly)

---

**Recommendation Based on Budget:**

| Budget | Method | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| $150/month | EDDM | Quarterly to 300 homes |
| $300/month | First Class | Monthly to 200 homes |
| $500/month | Platform CRM | Monthly to 300 homes |
| $1000/month | Mix: EDDM + Digital Ads | Bi-weekly mail + daily digital |

---

### 🔍 Topic 6: Warm Call Script for Circle Prospecting

**What is a Warm Call?**
Calling neighbors AFTER you've sold a property in their area (you have a reason to call = "warm")

**vs. Cold Call:** Calling strangers with no connection

---

**The Perfect Warm Call Script:**

```
"Hi, is this [Homeowner Name]?

This is [Your Name] with Christie's International Real Estate.

I wanted to reach out because I just sold the house at
123 Oak Street in your neighborhood.

Because of that sale, I now have several buyers specifically
asking about your area who couldn't get that house.

I'm calling neighbors to see if anyone is thinking about
making a move, or knows someone who might be.

Is that you, or do you know anyone?"

[PAUSE - Let them respond]
```

---

**Possible Responses & Your Follow-Up:**

**Response 1: "Actually, I have been thinking about it"**

Your reply:
```
"That's great timing!

I'd love to stop by and give you a free market analysis
showing what your home is worth based on the Oak Street sale.

I have some time Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning -
which works better for you?"
```

---

**Response 2: "How much did Oak Street sell for?"**

Your reply:
```
"It sold for $875,000.

Based on that sale and comparing your home, I'd estimate
yours is worth around $850,000 to $900,000.

Would you like me to run a detailed analysis?
I can email it to you - no obligation, just so you know
what you're sitting on.

What's the best email for you?"
```

---

**Response 3: "No, I'm not selling"**

Your reply:
```
"No problem at all!

Do you happen to know any neighbors who might be considering a move?

Sometimes people mention things like downsizing or relocating for work."

[If they say no]

"Understood! Well, if you ever hear of anyone, feel free to
pass along my number. I specialize in this neighborhood.

By the way, would you like me to send you an email with
recent sales data? Just so you know what's happening
with property values on your street?"
```

---

**Response 4: "I already have an agent"**

Your reply:
```
"That's great! It's always good to have someone you trust.

If they ever get too busy or you want a second opinion
on value, feel free to give me a call.

In the meantime, do you know any neighbors who might
be looking to sell?"
```

---

**Response 5: "Take me off your list"**

Your reply:
```
"Absolutely, I'll make sure you don't get any more calls.

I apologize for the interruption. Have a great day!"

[Mark in CRM: Do Not Call]
```

---

**Key Success Factors:**

✅ **Call within 48 hours of sale** (momentum is high)
✅ **Mention the specific address** ("123 Oak Street" not "a house")
✅ **Lead with THEIR benefit** ("buyers asking about your area")
✅ **Always ask for referrals** (even if they're not selling)
✅ **Offer free value** (market analysis, sales data)

---

**Volume Expectations:**

**250 calls will result in:**
- 100 no answers / voicemails
- 80 "not interested"
- 40 "maybe in the future"
- 20 "send me information"
- 5 "yes, let's meet"
- **2-3 actual listings** (within 6 months)

**Math:**
```
3 listings × $15,000 average commission = $45,000
÷ 250 calls
= $180 per phone call made
```

→ Worth your time? YES.

---

**Time Blocking for Circle Prospecting:**

**Best Times to Call:**
- **Tuesday-Thursday:** 10am-12pm, 4pm-7pm
- **Saturday:** 10am-2pm
- **Avoid:** Monday mornings, Friday evenings, Sunday

**Call Volume:**
- 20-30 calls per hour
- Block 2 hours = 40-60 contacts
- Do this 2x per week = 80-120 contacts weekly

---

## 💡 Final Thoughts - Day 5

**The Big Picture:**

Most agents fail because they:
- ❌ Wait for business to come to them
- ❌ Don't use technology to find opportunities
- ❌ Give up after a few rejections
- ❌ Don't track their activities or results

**You will succeed because you:**
- ✅ Use Remine to find motivated sellers BEFORE they list
- ✅ Use UPCity to get buyer leads delivered to your phone
- ✅ Follow proven scripts that work
- ✅ Track your metrics and improve constantly
- ✅ Commit to the volume required (250 calls, 20 touches, etc.)

---

**Remember:**

> "Success in real estate is not about knowing secrets.
> It's about doing the basics that everyone knows,
> but most agents won't do consistently."

**The basics:**
1. Generate leads (Remine + UPCity)
2. Contact leads quickly (3-minute calls)
3. Meet leads in person (within 12 days)
4. Present value proposition (why work with you)
5. Follow up relentlessly (7-day updates, 2-year nurture)
6. Close deals (serve clients well)
7. Repeat (ask for referrals, circle prospect)

---

**Next Steps:**

✅ Complete tonight's homework
✅ Practice scripts out loud
✅ Bring materials to class tomorrow
✅ Be ready to make real calls
✅ Commit to the process

# Day 5 - Topic 02: Farming Strategies & ARM Loan Targeting

**Topic:** Advanced prospecting strategies using mortgage data
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Time Investment:** 1-2 hours setup, ongoing monthly maintenance

---

## 🎯 What is Farming?

**Farming** = Building a predictable pipeline of listings from a specific geographic area or demographic group through consistent, repeated contact.

### Not Farming
❌ Random cold calling
❌ One-time mailer to 5,000 people
❌ Buying generic leads online

### True Farming
✅ **Defined territory:** Specific neighborhood or group
✅ **Consistent contact:** Minimum 20 touches over 12 months
✅ **Value delivery:** Market updates, expertise, not just "call me"
✅ **Long-term commitment:** Results in 6-18 months, not 6 weeks

## 💣 The ARM Bomb Strategy (Highest ROI)

### What is an ARM?

**ARM = Adjustable Rate Mortgage**

**How It Works:**
```
Years 1-5: Fixed at low rate (e.g., 2.5%)
Year 6+: Rate adjusts annually based on market
         Can increase up to 2% per year
         Cap of 5-6% total increase over life of loan
```

**Example Timeline:**
```
2019: Took ARM at 2.5% fixed for 5 years
2024: Rate adjusts to 6.5% (market rate)
2025: Rate adjusts to 8.5% (if rates still high)

Monthly payment potentially DOUBLES
```

---

### Why ARMs Are a Gold Mine Right Now (2024-2025)

**The Perfect Storm:**

**2019-2021:**
- Interest rates at historic lows (2-3%)
- Many homeowners took 5-year ARMs
- Saved money vs. fixed-rate mortgages

**2024-2025:**
- Those ARMs are now resetting
- Current rates: 6.5-7.5%
- Payment shock is MASSIVE

**The Homeowner's Dilemma:**
```
Option 1: Refinance to fixed rate
         Problem: Going from 2.5% to 7% = payment increase anyway

Option 2: Stay in ARM
         Problem: Rate keeps adjusting upward annually

Option 3: SELL THE HOUSE
         Solution: Downsize, move to lower cost area, or cash out equity
```

---

### Finding ARM Borrowers in Remine

**Step-by-Step Filter Setup:**

**Filter 1: Property Value**
```
Minimum: $1,000,000
Why: Higher loan amounts = bigger payment shock
```

**Filter 2: Loan Type**
```
Select: ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage)
Why: These are your targets
```

**Filter 3: Interest Rate**
```
Maximum: 4.5%
Why: If current rate is under 4.5%, it WILL reset higher
```

**Filter 4: Ownership Time**
```
Minimum: 5+ years
Why: Most ARMs have 5-7 year fixed period (now expiring)
```

**Filter 5: Geography**
```
Your target area (zip code or drawn area)
Why: Stay in serviceable territory
```

**Result:** List of homeowners facing imminent payment shock

### The Math You'll Present

**ARM Borrower's Current Situation:**

```
Original ARM (2019):
Loan Amount: $800,000
Initial Rate: 2.5%
Monthly Payment: $3,162

After Reset (2024):
Loan Amount: $750,000 (paid down slightly)
New Rate: 7.0%
New Monthly Payment: $4,987

Annual Increase: $21,900
```

**Downsizing Option:**

```
Sell current home: $1,200,000
Pay off loan: -$750,000
Net proceeds: $450,000 (minus closing costs)

Buy smaller home: $850,000
New loan: $400,000 (put $450K down)
Rate: 7.0% (same rate, but smaller loan)
New payment: $2,661

SAVINGS: $2,326/month = $27,912/year
```

**Your Value Proposition:**
> "Yes, rates are higher. But if we right-size your home and loan, your total housing cost goes DOWN, not up."

## 🏡 Geographic Farming vs. Demographic Farming

### Geographic Farming

**Definition:** Focus on specific neighborhood/area

**Best For:**
- Areas you know well

Property Value: $1M+
Ownership Time: 10+ years
```

**Commitment:**
- 100-300 homes
- 20+ touches per year
- 2-3 years to dominate

---

### Demographic Farming (ARM Strategy)

**Definition:** Focus on specific borrower type regardless of location

**Best For:**
- Covering wider territory
- When you don't live in target area
- Specialized expertise (mortgage transitions)

**Remine Setup:**
```
Geography: Entire county or multiple towns
Loan Type: ARM
Rate: Under 4.5%
Value: $800K+
```

**Commitment:**

## 🎯 Advanced ARM Targeting Tactics

### Tactic 1: The Rate Reset Calendar

**Strategy:** Identify WHEN their ARM resets, contact them 3 months before

**How:**

**In Remine:**
- Filter: Mortgage Age = 4-5 years
- These ARMs likely reset in next 12 months

**Your Timeline:**
```
ARM taken out: January 2020 (5-year fixed)
Reset date: January 2025

Your outreach: October 2024
Message: "Your rate resets in 3 months. Let's discuss options NOW."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Urgency (it's happening soon)
- You're the expert who saw it coming
- They haven't talked to other agents yet

---

### Tactic 2: The Equity Amplifier

**Strategy:** Target ARMs with high equity (easier to move)

**Remine Filters:**
```
Loan Type: ARM
Rate: Under 4.5%
Equity: $300,000+ (40%+ equity)
```

**Why:**
- High equity = can afford to move
- Not stuck/underwater
- Can make significant downsize

**Your Pitch:**
> "You have $400,000 in equity. That's enough to buy a smaller home outright and eliminate your mortgage payment entirely. Would you like to see what that would look like?"

---

### Tactic 3: The Divorce/Life Change Cross-Reference

**Strategy:** Combine ARM filter with other motivation indicators

**Remine Filters:**
```
Loan Type: ARM
Rate: Under 4.5%
Ownership: Single owner (possible divorce)
OR
Property Type: 4+ bedrooms (empty nesters)
```

**Logic:**
- ARM reset + divorce = strong sell motivation
- ARM reset + empty nest = natural transition point

---

## 📞 Objection Handling for ARM Prospects

### Objection 1: "I'm just going to refinance"

**Your Response:**
```
"That makes sense. Have you spoken to a lender yet about
what rate you'd qualify for?

[They answer 7%]

So if I understand correctly, you'd go from 2.5% to 7%,
which still increases your payment significantly.

Have you considered whether downsizing might give you
a lower total housing cost, even at 7%?

I have a calculator that shows both scenarios - would you
like me to run the numbers for you?"
```

---

### Objection 2: "Rates will come down soon"

**Your Response:**
```
"You might be right - many economists are predicting that.

But even if rates drop to 5-6%, that's still double your
current rate.

And here's what I'm seeing: Many homeowners are waiting
for rates to drop, which means when rates DO drop, there
will be a flood of homes on the market.

The advantage of selling now:
1. Less competition (fewer listings)
2. You can negotiate from strength
3. If you're downsizing, you BENEFIT from lower prices now

Does that make sense?"
```

---

### Objection 3: "I love my house, I don't want to move"

**Your Response:**
```
"I completely understand - you've built a life there.

Let me ask: If your payment increases $2,000-3,000/month,
what would you have to give up to afford it?

[Let them think]

Because for many families, that's:
- Private school tuition, or
- Family vacations, or
- Retirement savings

I'm not saying you should definitely sell. I'm saying
let's look at all your options, including creative ways
to stay if that's what's most important to you.

Fair enough?"
```

---

### Objection 4: "The market is bad right now"

**Your Response:**
```
"I understand the concern. The market HAS changed.

But here's what many people don't realize:

If you're downsizing, a 'bad market' actually HELPS you.

Here's why:
- Yes, your home is worth 10% less than peak
- But the smaller home you're buying is ALSO 10% less
- Since you're going from bigger to smaller, you actually
  come out ahead

Would you like me to show you the actual numbers for
your situation?"
```

× 60% contact rate (phone)
= 120 conversations

120 conversations
× 15% interested in market analysis
= 18 market analysis requests

18 market analyses
× 30% convert to appointment
= 5-6 appointments

## ❓ FAQ - ARM Farming

**Q: What if they already refinanced?**

A: Remove them from ARM farm, add them to general database. They're no longer ARM prospects, but still potential sellers in future.

---

**Q: What if they get defensive when I call?**

A: Adjust approach. Instead of "I know you have an ARM," try "I'm offering free market analysis to homeowners in your neighborhood." Less invasive.

---

**Q: Should I mention I got their info from data research?**

A: No. Simply say "I'm reaching out to homeowners in [neighborhood]." If they ask how you got their number, say "public records."

---

**Q: What if rates actually DO drop significantly?**

A: Your ARM farm becomes less motivated, BUT you've built relationships. Transition to general geographic farm messaging. Your consistency still pays off.

---

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

**ARM Farming Works Because:**

✅ **Specific trigger:** Rate reset is a real, measurable event
✅ **Financial pressure:** Payment increases force action
✅ **Timing:** You can predict when they'll need help
✅ **Less competition:** Most agents don't target this niche
✅ **Value-add:** You actually solve a problem (not just selling)

**Success Formula:**

```
Right Target (ARM borrowers facing reset)
+ Right Message (you have options)
+ Right Timing (before reset hits)
+ Consistent Follow-Up (20+ touches)
= Predictable Listings
```

---

**Next Steps:**

1. ✅ Build your ARM farm TODAY (200 properties)
2. ✅ Send first mailer this week
3. ✅ Start calling next week (15/day minimum)
4. ✅ Track everything in CRM
5. ✅ Commit to 12-month campaign

**Remember:** Farming is a marathon, not a sprint. The agents who win are those who consistently show up for 12-18 months.

## 📞 Warm Call Script (Circle Prospecting)

### The Setup

**You just sold 123 Main Street in Ridgewood.**

**You're calling 250 neighbors.**

**This is a "warm" call because you have a REASON to call (recent sale).**

---

### The Perfect Warm Call Script

**Version 1: Full Script (45-60 seconds)**

```
"Hi, is this [Homeowner Name]?

Great! This is [Your Name] with Christie's International Real Estate.

I wanted to reach out because I just sold the house at
123 Main Street in your neighborhood.

Because of that sale, I now have several buyers specifically
asking about your area who couldn't get that house.

I'm calling neighbors to see if anyone is thinking about
making a move, or knows someone who might be.

Is that you, or do you know anyone?"

[PAUSE - Wait for response]
```

---

**Version 2: Shorter Version (30 seconds)**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Christie's.

I just sold 123 Main Street down the street from you.

I have buyers asking about your neighborhood now.

Are you or anyone you know thinking about selling?"

[PAUSE]
```

---

**Version 3: "Value First" Approach (60 seconds)**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Christie's.

I recently sold 123 Main Street for $875,000, and because
of the strong buyer interest in your neighborhood, I wanted
to reach out.

I'm offering free market analyses to neighbors so you know
what your home is worth in today's market.

Would you like me to prepare one for you? No obligation,
just valuable information."

[Most say yes to free analysis]
```

---

## 🎭 Role Play Scenario 1: The Perfect Call

### Scenario

**You:** Agent calling about recent sale
**Partner:** Homeowner who's been thinking about selling

---

**Your lines:**

```
"Hi, is this Mrs. Johnson?

Great! This is Sarah with Christie's International Real Estate.

I wanted to reach out because I just sold the house at
123 Main Street in your neighborhood.

Because of that sale, I now have several buyers specifically
asking about your area who couldn't get that house.

I'm calling neighbors to see if anyone is thinking about
making a move, or knows someone who might be.

Is that you, or do you know anyone?"
```

---

**Partner's line:**

```
"Actually, we have been thinking about downsizing. The kids
are gone and this house is too big now."
```

---

**Your response:**

```
"That's great timing!

I'd love to stop by and give you a free market analysis
showing what your home is worth based on the Main Street sale.

I specialize in helping empty nesters transition to their
next chapter, and I can also connect you with resources for
downsizing if you'd like.

I have some time Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning -
which works better for you?"
```

---

**Partner's line:**

```
"Wednesday morning works. What time?"
```

---

**Your response:**

```
"Perfect! How about 10am? I'll bring a detailed market analysis
and we can discuss your timeline and goals.

Can I get your best email so I can send you a confirmation?"

[Get email]

"Great! I'll see you Wednesday at 10am. Looking forward to it!"
```

**Call duration:** 2 minutes. Perfect.

---

## 🎭 Role Play Scenario 2: The "How Much Did It Sell For?" Call

### Scenario

**You:** Agent calling about sale
**Partner:** Curious neighbor who wants to know sale price

---

**Your opening:**

```
[Same opening as Scenario 1]
```

---

**Partner's line:**

```
"Yeah, I saw that house sold. How much did it go for?"
```

---

**Your response:**

```
"It sold for $875,000.

Based on that sale and comparing your home - I see you're
at 456 Oak Street - I'd estimate yours is worth around
$850,000 to $900,000, depending on updates and condition.

Would you like me to run a detailed analysis?
I can email it to you - no obligation, just so you know
what you're sitting on.

What's the best email for you?"
```

---

**Partner options:**

**Option A (Good):**
```
"Sure, send it over. My email is john@email.com"
```

**Your response:**
```
"Perfect! I'll have that to you by tomorrow afternoon.

By the way, once you see the analysis, if you want to
discuss it or have any questions, I'm happy to stop by
for a quick 15-minute chat. No pressure.

Does that work?"

[They say yes]

"Great! I'll include my cell in the email. Talk soon!"
```

---

**Option B (Hesitant):**
```
"I don't know... we're not really thinking about selling right now."
```

**Your response:**
```
"That's perfectly fine! A lot of homeowners aren't actively
selling, but they still like to know what their home is worth.

Think of it like checking your stock portfolio - you're not
necessarily selling, but it's good to know the value.

No obligation, no pressure. Just information. Should I send
it to your email?"

[Most say yes at this point]
```

---

## 🎭 Role Play Scenario 3: The "I Already Have an Agent" Call

### Scenario

**You:** Calling about recent sale
**Partner:** Loyal to another agent

---

**Your opening:**

```
[Same opening as Scenario 1]
```

---

**Partner's line:**

```
"Thanks, but I already have an agent I work with."
```

---

**Your response:**

```
"That's great! It's always good to have someone you trust.

Quick question though - are they local to this specific
neighborhood? Because I specialize right here and I've sold
[X] homes on this street specifically.

If they ever get too busy or you want a second opinion on
value for your specific street, feel free to give me a call.

In the meantime, do you know any neighbors who might be
thinking about selling? I'd be happy to help them out."
```

---

**Partner options:**

**Option A:**
```
"Well, my agent is in another town. You know this street better?"
```

**Your response:**
```
"I do! I've been working this neighborhood for [X years], and
I just sold 123 Main for $875K in only 12 days.

What I find is that hyper-local expertise makes a difference.

If you're curious, I'd be happy to show you what I'd do
differently to sell YOUR house specifically. No obligation to
switch agents, just information.

Can I stop by for 15 minutes this week?"

[Many will say yes - they're curious]
```

---

**Option B:**
```
"No, I'm good. Not interested."
```

**Your response:**
```
"Understood! If you know anyone on the street who might be
interested, feel free to pass along my name.

Have a great day!"

[Mark in CRM: Has agent, not interested]
[Move on]
```

---

## 🎭 Role Play Scenario 4: The Objection Master Class

### Objection 1: "I'm on the Do Not Call list"

**Partner:**
```
"How did you get this number? I'm on the Do Not Call list!"
```

**Your response:**
```
"I apologize if this is a bad time. The Do Not Call list
doesn't apply to real estate agents calling about a specific
recent transaction in your neighborhood.

But I certainly respect your privacy. Would you like me to
make sure you don't receive any future calls from me?"

[They usually calm down at this point]

[If they say yes to remove:]

"Absolutely. I'll mark you as do not call. Have a great day!"
```

---

### Objection 2: "What's your commission?"

**Partner:**
```
"Before we talk, what do you charge? What's your commission?"
```

**Your response:**
```
"Great question, and I'm happy to discuss that.

My commission is competitive with the market, typically
between 5-6% total, with half going to the buyer's agent.

But here's what's more important than the commission - what
you NET from the sale.

I've found that agents who charge less often don't invest
in professional photography, staging, or targeted marketing,
which costs you tens of thousands in a lower sale price.

I'd rather you pay me 6% and net $50,000 more than pay
someone 4% and net less overall.

Does that make sense?"
```

---

### Objection 3: "I want to think about it"

**Partner:**
```
"I need to think about it and talk to my spouse."
```

**Your response:**
```
"Absolutely! This is a big decision and you should definitely
discuss it together.

What I'd suggest is this: Let me prepare the market analysis
showing what your home is worth. Then you and your spouse can
review it together and discuss whether the timing makes sense.

If the number is higher than you expected, it might accelerate
your decision. If it's lower, you'll know to wait.

Either way, you'll have real data to discuss. Should I prepare
that for you?"

[Most say yes]
```

## 🎯 Practice Tips

### Tip 1: Start with ChatGPT

**Use AI for practice:**

**Prompt:**
```
"You are a homeowner who just saw your neighbor's house sell.
I'm going to practice my real estate cold calling script on you.
Please respond realistically with objections, questions, and
varied scenarios. Let's start."
```

**Then practice your script.**

**ChatGPT will:**
- Ask realistic questions
- Raise common objections
- Vary responses (interested, skeptical, rude)
- Give you practice without real-world pressure

---

### Tip 2: Record and Review

**Process:**
1. Record 5 practice calls (voice memo app)
2. Listen back
3. Note:
   - Filler words count
   - Confidence level (1-10)
   - Clarity of message
   - Speed (too fast? too slow?)

**Goal:** Identify bad habits before they become ingrained

---

### Tip 3: Practice in Front of Mirror

**Why:**
- See your facial expressions
- Practice smiling while talking (it comes through in your voice)
- Body language affects tone

**Try this:**
- Stand up while calling (more energy)
- Smile before you dial (warmer tone)
- Use hand gestures (even though they can't see you - it helps energy)

---

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: The Pattern Interrupt

**Problem:** They're expecting a sales pitch

**Solution:** Start differently

**Instead of:**
```
"Hi, I'm a real estate agent and I want to sell your house."
```

**Try:**
```
"Hi, I'm calling neighbors because I just sold a house on your
street and I'm curious - have you noticed any changes in the
neighborhood lately?"

[They talk about neighborhood]

"Interesting! Well, the reason I ask is that buyers are really
interested in this area right now. Are you or anyone you know
thinking about selling?"
```

**Why it works:** Feels like a conversation, not a sales pitch

---

### Technique 2: The Referral Pivot

**If they're not interested, ALWAYS ask for referrals:**

```
"No problem at all! By the way, who else on the street might
be thinking about selling? I know you probably know your neighbors
better than I do."
```

**Often they'll say:**
```
"Well, the Johnsons two doors down mentioned something..."
```

**Your response:**
```
"Perfect! What's their address? I'll give them a call.

And feel free to mention to them that I'll be calling -
that way it's not completely out of the blue."
```

**Result:** Warm introduction to next prospect

---

### Technique 3: The Future Follow-Up

**Even if they say NO today, set up future contact:**

```
Them: "Not interested right now."

You: "No problem! Let me ask - if something changed in the
next 6-12 months and you DID want to sell, would you be open
to me checking in with you then?

Just a quick call to see if anything's changed?"

[Most say yes to this]

"Great! I'll put a note to follow up in [6 months]. And in the
meantime, I'll send you my monthly market updates so you can
see what's happening in the neighborhood. Sound good?"
```

**Result:** Permission for future contact + email capture

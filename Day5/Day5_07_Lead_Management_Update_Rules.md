# Day 5 - Topic 07: Lead Management & Update Rules

**Topic:** The 7-day update rule and pipeline organization
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Time Commitment:** 1 hour/week minimum

## 🎯 The 7-Day Update Rule

### What It Is

**Every lead in your UPCity pipeline must be updated every 7 days.**

**No exceptions.**

**What happens if you miss:**
1. System sends warning email
2. You become "DELINQUENT"
3. All new leads STOP immediately
4. Must call support to reactivate
5. They audit your pipeline before reactivating

**Bottom Line:** Don't miss updates.

---

### What Counts as an Update

**Good news: The bar is LOW.**

**ANY of these count:**

✅ "Called client, no answer"
✅ "Left voicemail"
✅ "Sent email, awaiting response"
✅ "Showed 2 properties, client still looking"
✅ "No activity this week"
✅ "Client on vacation"
✅ "Working with another agent"
✅ Literally ANYTHING you type

**What doesn't count:**

❌ Nothing (leaving it blank)

**That's it. Just type SOMETHING.**

---

## 📋 The Update Workflow

### Method 1: Weekly Batch Update (Recommended)

**Time:** Block 1 hour every Monday morning

**Process:**

**Step 1: Open UPCity App**
- Go to "All Leads" view

**Step 2: Sort by "Last Updated"**
- Oldest first (these need updates ASAP)

**Step 3: Go Through Each Lead**

**For Active Leads** (currently working with):
```
Update: "Showed 3 properties on Saturday. Client interested in
2 of them. Scheduling second showings for this weekend."
```
(Takes 30 seconds, provides real info)

**For Warm Leads** (occasional contact):
```
Update: "Sent monthly market update email. No response yet.
Will call next week."
```
(Takes 10 seconds)

**For Cold Leads** (long-term nurture):
```
Update: "No activity. Client timeline 6+ months. Next check-in: 12/1."
```
(Takes 5 seconds)

**Step 4: Mark All as Updated**
- System resets 7-day clock for all

---

### Method 2: Real-Time Update (As You Go)

**Right after EVERY contact:**

**After phone call:**
- Open app immediately
- Click on that lead
- Add note: "Called, discussed 3 properties, sending listings via email"
- Save

**After showing:**
- In the car after appointment
- Open app
- Add note: "Showed property, client loved it, discussing offer"
- Save

**After email:**
- Right after sending
- Open app
- Add note: "Sent 5 new listings matching criteria"
- Save

**Why this is better:**
- Fresh in your mind
- Won't forget details
- Spreads out the work
- Never miss an update

## ⏰ Time Management Strategies

### The Monday Morning System

**9:00am - 10:00am: UPCity Update Hour**

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Open UPCity app
- [ ] Sort leads by "Last Updated" (oldest first)
- [ ] Set timer for 60 minutes
- [ ] Update leads in order:

**First 20 minutes: HOT leads (score 9-10)**
- Detailed updates
- Review next actions
- Schedule calls/showings for the week

**Next 20 minutes: WARM leads (score 6-8)**
- Quick status updates
- Flag any that need promotion to HOT
- Schedule follow-ups

**Last 20 minutes: COLD leads (score 3-5)**
- Batch updates (copy/paste templates)
- Quick review for any engagement signals
- Remove any that should be DEAD

**DEAD leads: Don't update** (archive them)

---

### The Daily Touch System

**Alternative to batching:**

**Every time you touch a lead (call, email, showing):**

1. Immediately open UPCity app
2. Find that lead
3. Add update (30 seconds)
4. Close app

**Pros:**
- Never forget details
- Fresh updates
- Spreads out the work

**Cons:**
- Requires discipline (easy to skip)
- Can be disruptive

**Best for:** Agents with fewer leads (under 30 active)

---

## 🚨 Avoiding Delinquent Status

### Warning Signs

**You're at risk if:**
- ⚠️ You have 50+ leads
- ⚠️ You don't have a system
- ⚠️ You're manually tracking (not using app)
- ⚠️ You update "when you remember"
- ⚠️ You've missed updates before

### The Safety Net

**Strategy 1: Phone Reminder**

**Set recurring phone alert:**
- Every Sunday at 8pm
- Message: "Update UPCity leads tomorrow morning"
- Can't be snoozed or dismissed

**Why Sunday evening:**
- Prepares you for Monday morning
- Weekend downtime to review
- Monday morning ready to execute

---

**Strategy 2: Calendar Block**

**Block Monday 9-10am in calendar:**
- Title: "UPCity Updates (DO NOT SKIP)"
- Recurring: Every week
- Set as "Busy" (so no one schedules over it)
- Add alarm/reminder

---

**Strategy 3: Accountability Partner**

**Find another agent in UPCity:**
- Text each other every Monday: "Did you update?"
- Friendly competition: "I updated all 50, how about you?"
- Mutual accountability

## 💡 Smart Filter Combinations

### Strategy 1: The ARM Bomb (High Probability Sellers)

**Goal:** Find homeowners whose mortgage payments are about to skyrocket

**Filters to Apply:**

```
Property Value: $1,000,000 minimum
Ownership Time: 20+ years
Loan Type: ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage)
Interest Rate: Under 4.5%
```

**Why This Works:**

**The Math:**
```
Current ARM Rate: 2.0%
Monthly Payment: $5,000

Reset Rate: 7.0%
New Monthly Payment: $10,000+

Result: Cannot afford doubled payment → MUST SELL
```

**Your Approach:**
These homeowners are **highly motivated** but may not realize it yet. Your job is to contact them BEFORE the rate resets.

**Script:**
> "Hi, I'm calling neighbors in the area. I have buyers interested in your neighborhood. Do you know anyone thinking about selling?"

When they say "Actually, I've been considering it..." → You've found gold.

---

### Strategy 2: The Equity Play

**Goal:** Find homeowners with enough equity to make a move

**Filters:**
```
Property Value: $800,000 minimum
Equity: $200,000 minimum (25%+)
Ownership Time: 10+ years
```

**Why This Works:**

**The Psychology:**
- After 10+ years, many want a change
- $200K+ equity = can afford to move
- Not underwater = no financial stress preventing sale

**Your Approach:**
These are "lifestyle change" sellers:
- Empty nesters (kids gone to college)
- Upsizers (need more space)
- Relocators (job change, retirement)

**Your Message:**
> "After 10+ years in one home, many families start thinking about what's next. Whether it's downsizing, upgrading, or relocating, I'd love to help you explore your options."

---

### Strategy 3: The HELOC Signal

**Goal:** Find homeowners who pulled cash out (potential financial need)

**Filters:**
```
Property Value: $1,000,000+
HELOC: Yes
Equity: Less than $300,000 (high loan-to-value)
```

**Why This Works:**

**The Signal:**
A HELOC (second mortgage) indicates:
1. They needed cash recently
2. They chose NOT to sell (pulled HELOC instead)
3. They may be ready to sell now (tried to delay, but can't anymore)

**The Math:**
```
Home Value: $1,000,000
Equity: $250,000
→ Total Loans: $750,000 (75% LTV)
→ High debt load = rate-sensitive
```

**Your Approach:**
Soft, non-pressuring contact. They may be financially stressed.

**Script:**
> "Hi, I specialize in helping homeowners in [neighborhood] navigate their options. Whether you're staying or considering a move, I'd love to provide a free market analysis so you know where you stand. No obligation."

---

### Strategy 4: The Absentee Owner

**Goal:** Find investors or inherited properties (often unmotivated to maintain)

**Filters:**
```
Owner Occupied: No (absentee owner)
Property Value: $500,000+
Ownership Time: 5+ years
```

**Why This Works:**

**Common Scenarios:**
- Inherited property (sibling disputes, want to cash out)
- Tired landlord (ready to exit rental business)
- Out-of-state investor (management hassles)

**Your Approach:**
Position yourself as the solution to their headache.

**Script:**
> "Hi, I noticed you own the property at 123 Main Street. As an out-of-area owner, you might appreciate a local expert's perspective on the market. Values have increased significantly—would you like a free property valuation?"

---

### Strategy 5: The Long-Term Owner (Classic Downsizer)

**Goal:** Find retirees and empty nesters ready to downsize

**Filters:**
```
Ownership Time: 25+ years
Property Value: $700,000+
Property Type: Single Family
Bedrooms: 4+
```

**Why This Works:**

**The Psychology:**
- 25+ years = kids are grown and gone
- Large house = too much to maintain
- Significant equity = can afford nice downsized home

**Statistics:**
> After 25 years of ownership, approximately 15-20% of homeowners are actively considering a move within the next 2 years.

**Your Approach:**
Empathy and understanding, not pressure.

**Script:**
> "After raising a family in a home for 25+ years, many homeowners start thinking about something more manageable. I specialize in helping longtime residents transition to their next chapter. Would you like to know what your home is worth in today's market?"

---

## 📊 Advanced Filter Techniques

### Using Multiple Filters Together

**The Funnel Approach:**

Start broad, narrow down:

```
Step 1: Select zip code (e.g., 07446)
        Result: 8,000 properties

Step 2: Add property value ($1M+)
        Result: 1,200 properties

Step 3: Add ownership time (20+ years)
        Result: 490 properties

Step 4: Add loan type (ARM)
        Result: 29 properties

Final: 29 highly targeted prospects
```

---

### Understanding Equity vs. Original Loan

**⚠️ Common Mistake:**

Using "Original Loan Amount" for long-term owners (20+ years).

**Why It's Wrong:**
```
Bought in 2000: Original loan $300,000
Refinanced in 2015: New loan $500,000
Refinanced in 2019: New loan $400,000

"Original Loan" shows $300,000 (WRONG)
Actual current loan: ~$380,000 (after paydown from 2019)
```

**Better Approach:**

Use **Equity Calculation:**
```
Property Value - Equity = Approximate Current Loan Balance

Example:
$1,000,000 value
- $200,000 equity
= $800,000 approximate loan balance
```

This is more accurate for long-term owners who've refinanced.

---

### The "Mortgage Age" Filter

**What It Tells You:**

How long ago they took out (or refinanced) their current mortgage.

**Use Case:**

**Find people who refinanced at LOW rates (now stuck):**

```
Mortgage Age: 2-4 years (refinanced 2020-2022)
Interest Rate: Under 3.5%
Property Value: $800,000+
```

**Why They're Stuck:**
- Locked in 2.5%-3.5% rates
- Today's rates are 7%+
- Moving means DOUBLING their rate
- BUT: Life changes force moves anyway (divorce, job, downsizing)

**Your Angle:**
Help them understand the **total cost** picture, not just the rate.

> "Yes, your rate will go up. But if you're moving to a smaller home or different area, your overall housing cost might still be LOWER. Let me show you the math."

---

## 🎨 Drawing Custom Areas

### The Drawing Tools

**3 Shape Options:**

1. **Circle**
   - Click center point
   - Drag to set radius
   - Best for: Radius around specific landmark

2. **Rectangle**
   - Click one corner
   - Drag to opposite corner
   - Best for: Defined neighborhoods with grid streets

3. **Polygon (Free-form)**
   - Click multiple points to create custom shape
   - Double-click to close shape
   - Best for: Irregular neighborhoods, school districts

---

### Drawing Best Practices

**Strategy: Match Neighborhoods, Not Zip Codes**

**Why?**

Zip codes often cross multiple neighborhoods with different price points.

**Example: Ridgewood, NJ (07450)**

```
North side: $1.5M+ homes
South side: $700K-900K homes

If you draw whole zip code:
→ Mixed data, diluted targeting

If you draw just north side:
→ Precise targeting of luxury market
```

**How to Draw Precisely:**

1. Zoom in close (street level)
2. Use satellite view (see physical neighborhoods)
3. Follow natural boundaries:
   - Major roads
   - Railroad tracks
   - Parks/open space
   - School attendance zones

---

## 📤 Exporting Data Like a Pro

### Method 1: Select All (Full Farm Export)

**When to Use:**
You've filtered to exactly who you want, and you want everyone (under 10,000).

**Steps:**

1. **Apply all filters** (verify count is under 10,000)

2. **Click "Select All"** checkbox (top of results list)
   - All properties in current filter are selected
   - Counter shows: "2,340 selected" (or whatever your count is)

3. **Click "Cart" button**

4. **Name your cart**
   - Use descriptive names: `Ridgewood_ARM_Nov2024`
   - NOT generic names: `List1`, `Farm`

5. **Click "Create"**

6. **Click "Add [X] properties to cart"**
   - System adds all selected properties
   - May take 30-60 seconds for large batches

7. **Go to "Cart" tab**
   - Verify all properties are there
   - Check count matches

---

### Method 2: Individual Selection (Cherry-Picking)

**When to Use:**
You want specific properties, not everyone in the filter.

**Steps:**

1. **Browse filtered results**

2. **Click the cart icon** on each property you want
   - OR click the small circle checkbox (left side of each listing)

3. **Properties auto-add to cart** as you click

4. **Create cart name** when prompted (first property only)

5. **Continue adding** (they go to same cart)

**Use Case Example:**

Client says: "I love Chestnut Street. Are there any houses for sale there?"

→ Filter for Chestnut Street
→ Select only properties on that specific street
→ Add to cart: `ChestnutSt_Buyer_Smith`
→ Monitor for new listings (call owners directly)

---

### Method 3: Map-Based Selection

**When to Use:**
You want a specific geographic cluster visible on the map.

**Steps:**

1. **Zoom to desired area**

2. **Click the "select" tool** (lasso icon)

3. **Draw around properties** you want

4. **All properties in drawn area = selected**

5. **Add to cart** (same as Method 1)

**Best For:**
- Specific blocks
- Around a landmark (near train station)
- Custom radius around your listing

---

## 💾 The Export Process

### Preparing to Export

**From Cart View:**

1. **Select which cart** to export (if you have multiple)

2. **Check the boxes:**
   - Select ALL properties in cart (click top checkbox)
   - OR select specific properties (individual checkboxes)

3. **Click "Export" button**

---

### Choosing Columns (CRITICAL STEP)

**A window appears with column options.**

**✅ ALWAYS CHECK ALL BOXES**

**Why?**

Even if you don't need a data field now, you might later. Examples:
- You're mailing, so you think "I don't need email"
- Later: You want to send an email campaign
- Problem: You already exported without email addresses
- Solution: Re-export (wastes time)

**Better:** Export everything once, delete columns in Excel if needed.

---

### Common Export Columns

**Property Information:**
- ✅ Address
- ✅ City, State, Zip
- ✅ Property Type
- ✅ Bedrooms/Bathrooms
- ✅ Square Footage
- ✅ Lot Size
- ✅ Year Built
- ✅ Property Value (estimated)

**Owner Information:**
- ✅ Owner Name(s)
- ✅ Mailing Address (if different from property)
- ✅ Phone Number(s)
- ✅ Email Address(es)

---

### Downloading Your File

**After clicking "Export":**

1. **System processes** (10 seconds to 2 minutes depending on size)

2. **Notification appears:**
   - Top of screen: "Your export is ready"
   - Or in "Alerts" bell icon

3. **Click "Download"**

4. **File downloads as CSV or Excel**
   - Usually downloads to your "Downloads" folder
   - Filename: `Remine_Export_Nov5_2024.csv` (or similar)

---

## 📊 Working with Exported Data

### Opening in Excel

**CSV File Format:**

Double-click the file → Opens in Excel (or Google Sheets)

**Common Issues & Fixes:**

**Problem 1: Phone numbers show as scientific notation**

```
Wrong: 2.01555E+11
Right: 201-555-1234
```

**Fix:**
1. Select phone number column
2. Right-click → Format Cells
3. Choose "Text" (not "Number")
4. Re-import data

**Problem 2: Leading zeros disappear from zip codes**

```
Wrong: 7450 (should be 07450)
Right: 07450
```

**Fix:**
1. Select zip code column
2. Format as "Text"
3. Add leading zero if missing: `="0"&A2` (if A2 contains 7450)

---

### Cleaning Your Data

**Before importing to CRM:**

**Step 1: Remove Duplicates**
- Excel: Data → Remove Duplicates
- Choose "Address" as the unique identifier

**Step 2: Verify Phone Numbers**
- Look for obvious errors: `000-000-0000` or `123-456-7890`
- Delete invalid numbers (better to have blank than wrong number)

**Step 3: Standardize Format**
- Ensure addresses are consistent
- Fix capitalization (Excel: `=PROPER(A2)` converts to Title Case)

**Step 4: Add Custom Fields**

Add columns for your use:
- `Source`: "Remine - ARM Farm Nov 2024"
- `Lead Score`: Assign 1-10 based on motivation
- `Call Status`: "Not Called", "Called - No Answer", etc.
- `Notes`: Leave blank for now

---

   - ✅ Assign to you (not another agent)

6. **Click "Import"**

7. **Verify import:**
   - Check a few contacts manually
   - Ensure all data transferred correctly

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Farm Too Large

**The Problem:**
```
Agent exports 5,000 properties
Tries to mail all 5,000
Cost: $7,500 for ONE mailing
Result: Cannot afford to follow up
```

**The Solution:**

Start with **100-300 properties** max.

**Better to:**
- Mail 200 people 10 times ($3,000)
- Than mail 2,000 people 1 time ($3,000)

**Rule of 20 Touches:**
You need **minimum 20 touches** to convert a cold lead.

---

### Mistake 2: Not Using Zip Code Search

**The Problem:**

Drawing on map in urban areas = **incomplete data** (especially buildings).

**The Solution:**

**Use ZIP CODE filter instead:**

```
Instead of: Drawing around Hoboken buildings
Try: Filter by zip code 07030
```

Result: More complete data, especially for condos/apartments.

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Mailing Address vs. Property Address

**The Scenario:**

Owner lives at different address than the property (absentee owner or investment property).

**Your Data Shows:**
```
Property Address: 123 Main St, Ridgewood, NJ
Mailing Address: 456 Oak Ave, Miami, FL
```

**What to Do:**

**For Mailers:** Use MAILING address (that's where they actually receive mail)

**For Property Analysis:** Use PROPERTY address

**In your export:**
- Both addresses should be in separate columns
- Choose the right one for your purpose

---

### Mistake 4: Mailing from Remine Directly

**Why It's Tempting:**

Remine has built-in mailer service. Just click, design, send. Easy!

**Why You Shouldn't:**

1. ❌ **No Christie's branding** - Generic templates
2. ❌ **Higher cost** - Remine takes a cut as middleman
3. ❌ **No company support** - If something breaks, you're on your own
4. ❌ **Not integrated with CRM** - Can't track who responded
5. ❌ **Limited templates** - Not optimized for luxury market

**Better Approach:**

```
Remine: Build farm & export data
↓
Platform CRM: Import contacts
↓
Platform: Design Christie's-branded mailer
↓
Platform: Send & track responses
```

---

### Mistake 5: Not Updating Your Farm

**The Problem:**

You export data in January. You call them in June using 5-month-old data.

**What Changed:**
- 3 properties already sold (you look foolish calling them)
- 2 phone numbers disconnected
- 1 owner died (very awkward call)

**The Solution:**

**Re-export every 30-60 days** to refresh data.

Or better:

**Use Remine alerts:**
- Set alerts for your saved searches
- Get notified when properties in your farm:
  - Go on market
  - Sell
  - Have owner changes
  - Have financial changes (new loan, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Advanced Strategies

### Strategy: The "Coming Soon" List

**Goal:** Find off-market properties to show buyers BEFORE MLS

**How:**

**Step 1: Build farm of motivated sellers** (using techniques above)

**Step 2: Call them with "soft" approach:**

> "Hi, I'm not calling to pressure you to list. But I'm building a list of homeowners who MIGHT consider selling in the next 6-12 months if the right offer came along. Would you be open to a conversation about what your home might be worth?"

**Step 3: Those who say "maybe":**

Add to your **"Coming Soon"** list in CRM.

**Step 4: When buyer calls looking in that area:**

> "Nothing active on MLS right now, but I have 3 homeowners in that neighborhood who've indicated they might consider selling. Would you like me to reach out to them on your behalf?"

**Result:**
- Buyer is impressed (exclusive access)
- Seller gets offers without MLS hassle
- You double-end the deal (both sides)

---

### Strategy: Reverse Prospecting (Find Buyers for Your Listing)

**Scenario:** Your listing has been on market 45 days, no offers.

**Remine Solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze your past 2-3 buyers** for similar properties
```
Where did they come from?
- Upstate NY? → Pull all upstate NY data
- Manhattan? → Pull Manhattan data
- Out of state? → Pull that state
```

**Step 2: Build profile in Remine:**
```
Location: Where past buyers came from
Property Value: Similar to what they owned before
Age: 50-65 (if downizers)
Property Type: What they sold (if you know)
```

**Step 3: Export that data**

**Step 4: Market your listing TO THEM specifically:**

> "I specialize in helping [New York/Connecticut/wherever] residents relocate to [your area]. I have an exclusive listing that just became available - not widely marketed yet. Would you like a private showing?"

---

### Strategy: The School District Play

**For Families:**

**Remine doesn't filter by school district directly, BUT:**

**Workaround:**

1. **Google the school district boundary map**

2. **Draw that EXACT boundary** in Remine (polygon tool)

3. **Apply family-focused filters:**
```
Bedrooms: 4+
Property Value: $600K+ (whatever your area)
Ownership: 15+ years (kids likely grown)
```

**Result:** Empty nesters in top school districts (ready to downsize)

**Your Pitch:**
> "After raising your family in [Top School District], you might be ready for something more manageable. I specialize in helping longtime residents like you transition while maximizing your home's value in this highly desirable district."

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How much does Remine cost?

**A:** Typically included in your Christie's agent fees. Check with your manager.

**A:** Yes! Remine covers most of the United States. Great for finding out-of-state buyer prospects.

### Q: How accurate is the equity/loan data?

**A:** Estimated accuracy is 80-85%. It's directional, not exact. Use it to identify potential, not as absolute truth.

### Q: Can I share my exported data with another agent?

**A:** Check your agreement. Generally, data is for YOUR use. Don't distribute to competitors.

### Q: How often is Remine data updated?

**A:** Varies by county. Generally 30-90 days lag from public records. Enough for farming, not for real-time transaction data.

### Q: What if a property shows "No phone number available"?

**A:** Common for privacy-conscious owners. You can:
- Mail them instead
- Try skip tracing service (additional cost)
- Visit in person (door knocking)

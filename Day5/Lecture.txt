Remine lecture


Have million more value and then I have ownership type of 20 plus years and have a long time that's an arm so you can you know now you have 29 people who potentially could be in your farm here you can even you know I mean 29 is pretty slow low number you can literally pull this and call all of them or you could just say OK show me even you know the ones that have a rate of you know anywhere you know under 4 1/2 percent so the idea here actually all of them have under 4 1/2 percent So what what is this talents the talus basically those 29 households they have a loan over $1,000,000 they have a property value million dollar more they have an ARM on their you know on the House which means that their their rate will have to reset at some time we know that their rate is under 4 1/2 so they're going to potentially their mortgage payment is going to go up so much at some time because now if you refund they're going to be in the you know the best case scenario in the 5 1/2 to 6% So the mortgage payment you know is gonna go up tremendously which means in some cases they will not be able to afford it and they're gonna have themselves right so that means that this is a strategy you can build I don't OK just thinking a little bit OK what could you know trigger someone to sell this is a simple strategy that you can trigger that or you can you can build a farm here and this is just what we have on the map you can you know zoom out in here to increase the number from 29 to you know a little bit of bigger farm but 29 people will take you less than half an hour to call all of them even on a regular phone and see hey can I help you know and you don't have tell them hey are you looking to sell you can just call them for runs hey I'm calling the neighborhood I have a buy who's interested in in purchasing in the area do you know anyone who's looking to sell and then the idea is for them to say Oh yeah I'm interested actually and you know they're interested because you know they have already an arm that potentially is going to reset in the year or potentially two years where they're going to have to sell and they may want to sell now to log in their you could pee that that too it's fun to do the mortgage age if you if you piggyback yeah you can you can use this app but usually for your 00 to 3% is usually less than five years all of them well yeah but they could have gotten it last year you know what I'm saying so thinking about that and you get you get exactly three valuable or two valuable results I mean that those people are going to their mortgage is going to refi on its own let's say our interest rates were 3% which used to be you can theoretically go to the 6% higher that they have an arm at 6% that are really troubles they have to get out right no no it's not because they would have if if it's resets now and if they have usually you have an arm before of that 2% so and that's why people took it But then now the rates went up so quickly that people didn't realize this can go up to 7% that quickly so now if you're going from a 2% to a 7% your mortgage payment can more than double and that means that you're instead of paying 5000 a month you have to pay 10,000 a month mortgage plus you know plus your taxes so probably you're going to have to sell because you're not going to be able to pay 10,000 very few people can do it you can also use not just the mortgage age and and those but you can actually use the amount of mortgage that they have in it like by using your you know your I don't think they have actually mortgage but they have their home equity so if you know their equity you know what their you know potential is their loan right so if you're looking at a million or more you say OK their equity is 200,000 you know their loan is is you know at least 800,000 because the bigger your loan the more going to be affected by the change in rate OK so it's just an idea of like a of a farm that you can use that's not necessarily your sphere in order for you to leverage sorry I didn't understand about the equity what you talked about so in the equity in the house is that basically how much is it's really like I know what what does it mean but to in the filters I did not understand what so you can say I want it you can put the amount and say show me because we said the value of the house is at least $1,000,000 yes right and you can say if the equity is you know a maximum of 200,000 OK so you know that the loan is 800,000 minutes You don't know i'm not a fan of this set up maybe only has 200,000 is not going to really affect OK so yes you can use the original loan especially if they bought within the last you know five years probably those they haven't refried because the rates are going up going up going up they probably didn't refi but I don't like the original one because if you're looking for 20 years we said people who live in the house for 20 years you don't know if they'll be five They bought the house for 500,000 maybe their loan was only 200,000 so you don't know really accuracy from that point of view but I like using the value of the house versus the equity they have to how much they already paid exactly and that's updated based on if they have a HELOC or if they know all that they have an option for HELO yeah so you can you can go in there and say OK I want to target Helog so it's a home equity line of credit which probably means that they have this is their 2nd mortgage on the House so you know like they have a 2nd loan on the House so you can use that as well I mean the key lock would be could be tricky to use but also it could be that it's not necessarily true but it could be that you know that they needed the money so they pulled the key lock on it didn't want to sell maybe they you know event they're trying to delay the sale but I put the equipment motivation Yeah it could be also most people out when they need you know to to do a big investment in the house and they don't want to refi because the rates went up so much so then they will pull you up One more thing I want to note about the map itself is that if you click these like you know blue numbers you get more So so it kind of you know it zooms in for you and then it'll show you now we're back to that what is the number in the blue dot in the blue dot how many properties how many properties do I use Yep how many properties there are in this map Based on the filter based on the filter based on your filters I'll take the key lock away and then theoretically it should change actually took all the filters away and then you'll see yeah now we'll clear the wall You can see how the number changes Yeah so and then same very quick so when you're doing your farms the numbers to keep an eye on is this one yeah because you remember all the cards together cannot be packed more than 10,000 so you can go on like you know as well you can go in the car delete some or export some on your computer so you have the data out there but in total you don't want to make sure that this is the manageable number for your farm so don't go especially if you're doing mailers the big mistake is you know it's going for a big farm because bit more and more households means more money you have to come up with so the idea so and and if typically there's a misconception where Asians think that you send one Mailer and you get you know someone called you to say I'm on the S it doesn't work it's usually like you want to you know right now in this this industry with all the technology you have to count at least over 20 touches in order for you so you can do 20 mailers because you basically will spend more than what you're making permission on the property for to send 20 mailers but you probably would want to do like you know call from calls text message email through the your CRM and platform and class and then you know so it's a mix of phone calls text messages emails through the the the the portals you know marketing emails in addition to using the system itself to contact them by sending them mailers you can do mailers from here like from within the portal i'm not a big fan you know you probably eat it's probably easier for you to do it from platform platform has all the templates already built for with Christy's all logos This will be you know very hard to build in here I just right here No


buyer doesn't liek the house but the neighborhood. 


So what I would do is I would you can do them from don't do it to do it from platform yeah I mean I would because in here I can tell you there's very few people even though it's built and I can guarantee you you can do it in here you know you can definitely have you know you can buy the sheets with like them and then you can put them in the machine and do it but this will do it i'm not a big fan from do it here because it's built if you want to have a partnership with a printer printing company they want to send it there so I wouldn't necessarily do it here but you can definitely export your data into your CRM and then you know I can tell you like for example from even having support on like OK I need to mail this doc I tell you there's probably 10 people in the company who know how to tell you how to do it like whether from Mark to have to build it from from platform as opposed to here nobody in our company really is using this beside our Legion team to really you know generate if you want people contacts not to send So if you're going to do a mail you're better off you're going to platform to do it instead of build it there I will build it there you download the information you get the data from you so exporting it yeah excel sheet from here did not do platform no he's doing it next week OK So what he will show you Mark is basically he's going to show you how you take this excel file that open and then you can put this data into platform or other CRMS if you have any and then you can generate everything in that pool so those CRM are very helpful to build campaigns to send you know automatic again to send an email to someone I wouldn't go blasting mailers unless you really probably did the the first step in advance like maybe talk to the client 1st you know have a nice conversation with them then I would spend the money because the mailers are probably the most expensive out of all the marketing you know things that you're going to do I would also introduce you know new things like digital ads that that are you know again a lot more cheaper than sending mail so you can have an ad for the farm of 500 people for the whole year it'll cost you maybe 1000 bucks and they will see you on you know every time they go on Google that you know you're basically a retargeting ad in addition to you can spend probably another 700 bucks a year they do like all their social media stuff like any If you want to target Ridgewood they'll say up to 10,000 contacts per month they will see you somewhere on the social media right specifically in that there is a lot more cheaper than sending 10,000 mailers that can tell you if you want to send the whole town of bridges it's going to cost you at least three or 4000 probably around $3000 minimum Yeah 'cause there's 8000 something household in Ridgewood so it's gonna be a lot more cost effective if you do digital and then use the mailers only for the ones that you're actually have specific content I know I know that RJ lex knows why wouldn't you do it from here it seems like it's so much easier so many steps I what I'm not a big fan of this because we don't control this really well so like if there's issues with it nobody can help him say OK you know this is what needs to be done and then there is no Christy stamped in here so remember like you want to send something that has that prestige logo your picture that's already built Yeah this is this is more a national platform remind as opposed to what you're going to have with Christy's is already branded in theirs where it's very simple by just uploading your data you click on a few buttons and you have this whole video easily done it's probably going to be cheaper also because this is they're probably getting Commission on allowing you to do this as a middle line if you want you're doing it directly you know look into it but we never really tried to do the mail from here But some people don't want to be hand off and do nothing and click on the button and you know they're willing to pay thousands of dollars for it well I had mailers to pre print it so that's why I have them it's not that I need them I need the logo Oh yeah then then you're better just do do it separately OK yeah it's going to be it's a hassle to take one by 1 and put the stickers on yeah but that's my life I mean I what I would probably suggest if you like to do millers is if you're targeting a specific neighborhood not like a sphere that's all that's separated you know what So the post office has something for every door directly it's a bulk yes yes every door directly you do that 0 you don't I did it first class but you can but you can select specific route if you go to the USPS website you can say OK and let's assume you talk to you know all these streets right usually like the streets are next to each other they're all serviced by the same mail and they call this the route so if you go on their website you're able to see what route this is and it's going to be like for example there's like probably five house 500 households here in that route Usually they're they're run like between one 50 to 300 you know route the 300 household per route typically so which means that when you're doing this it's easier for you to say I can send it to 300 households and it's a lot more cheaper for you than actually sending it to like even 100 so now you have you're hitting all 300 of them for the same price of 100 if I do on this EDD app so that's what I would do but you have to be in the same route that's the the the part So this is what you would do you would just area whether square circle or whatever and then these are the people do you do you filter it yeah When I sold the house I got the the 250 neighbors surrounding that area and I did a mail that's why I did first class because first class is a little more I think fault they throw away right away 1st they might look at it I don't know these were male these are envelopes so it was I wanted to know the envelope All right thanks Any questions.



Where so you can turn you can send send us an email send Angela an email you know we'll we'll make sure that we're we're able to have it's really easy to use you may have issues like the first time 1st couple time you use it especially what we noticed is how to build the part yeah that's the the steps on how to build a part are confusing and it's I think it's on purpose because they don't want to get it unlimited amount of data in there but ultimately you know those factories select all click on card name it download the data into it and export it That's the tricky part but to build you know itself like you can't break you know just go in there you know put any filters you want play with it say OK this is who I think these people will be selling because XYZ and then build a farm like this so you can't break it in most cases I'll just clear all the filters and then go back into like the map itself is the biggest value of of the software is the fact that you zoom in and out automatically adjust the household in it so use that first and then you know play with check what filters they have how can you you know combine them together to come up with like a more solid you know set of data and then try to export it you're having an issue angela's gonna give her email and then you shoot us an email we'll make sure that this address I'm gonna make a suggestion when you all go home play with it and we have a class tomorrow if you have a problem we'll go over it OK but what Sammy says is absolutely true gotta play with it but the next part that Angela does showing how to do the cards that's also my email if anybody can even read that If you need to reach us at Leaf Gen corporate and you want some to go through my CR my CIR my no they can just email no just email me OK We don't have we don't have a can you spell that I can't try to see yes BUCKENBERGER so a **** burger at christy's RENNJ .com Same as everybody's email Oh yeah Oh yeah So you're at Christy's R.E.M. and sounds what's your fault ABUCKENDEX OK OK cool I'm i'm going to make a suggestion since mostly everybody's brand new we start to begin just getting something into the car I guess I can probably practice too so so let's say we want to market to houses in a specific zip code 07446 Now we're going to put on some filters let's say we only want to market to houses that have that are $1,000,000 or more in valid and that's still kind of a lot so let's do where was the ownership time 20 plus years OK we're down to 490 that sounds better So carts to export your list of properties is over there on the right so you'll click Select all this box right here and now they're all 490 years selected you'll go over here to cart I will ask you to name your card Create click enter 0 and then add 490 properties to court and this is one of the tricky parts when you click on part you have to name it click on create and then Add all the data to that card OK so these are the one of the trickiest Just to recap select all cart name it create and I'm not gonna do it again OK Angela can you like instead of selecting all can you show how they could just hit the cart and just select certain ones because of yes OK alright so let's say you don't want all 490 and you want this one you can select you can either click this white you know button up here that will turn Gray when you select it and then you have one selected and then you can add it to the cart that way and I'm assuming this is that if you just want that one if you want to scroll through this list of properties and each one you find you want to click that little cart icon did everybody see that And then you will create your new card or wait a second you select your if you've already created a card you can select which one so we're going to put this into Ramsey even though I think it's already in there and you can do more than one yes you can do more than one I think this excellent so you can either as you're scrolling through and you see properties that you like you can you can click up here in this corner two selected now in skip fees for whatever reason Three selected maybe cart we're gonna put them in this And the big question is why would you do that because you have a customer who says I love this street but there's nothing there and so you can call them They're off market properties you can call them and see if they might be interested in moving right so right so Fern's point let's say they want to live on Brittany Court These are the three properties you'll you'll select because so remember we have filters on so all of these are not selected because these are the houses that comply with the filters So so see when you click it it highlighted blue over there Do another one both OK so and then same thing you'll either go like this maybe you want all of them and then you add them to your card cool yeah so OK and then from the cart do you remember now we go to our cart this is our random cart We want to export this data We have to select either OK let's say you want to only export one don't know why you would but if you wanted to you would select each one that you want to export or you can click this one at the top and select all of them and you click export Remember make sure that all the columns are checked so you'll make sure that all information is checked yeah and there you go And then like so remember it'll take a minute 'cause it's a bunch of properties a bunch of columns a bunch of information it'll pop up at the top that it's ready to download and you'll get a little alert here in the alerts Any more questions Can you create a new card 'cause I'm trying to do it on my computer and it it doesn't allow me to save it sure so there's two ways you can either come to your carts here and click this plus button up here and create your card with no properties in it this is just creating your cart so just going to call it new cart So you could do it this way and then go back to the search and then you know put each and then do the same steps little four put them in your cart select the new card and put them in there or you can select the properties that you want either all of them either all of them or none or one of them we're going to do all of them and then you'll come out here to cart and this is creating your card so you'll create the newest card create Yeah that's why I need to do that online my profile they say upload properties


Be a bio and target them No no no the buy so if you have a listing that for example sitting on the market right and it has a very unique let's assume it's a historical house and you are basically not able to sell it right and you're like OK I need to you know find fine tune the data to get maybe my potential buyer you can actually use all the New York data so you can target people I'll give an example now the company has a new development in Monmouth County you probably saw it So we basically build different profiles of who potentially could be a buyer for that because it's you know more high end prices than than what's around it so we build different profiles and then we put data from 2000 but we would pull data for example we noticed that two buyers came from like the same area in upstate New York so we pulled all the data from there similar to these two buyers have some same price point of those buyers and kind of created the profile and then pulled all the data inside the market right they're not buying in New York you're just you're just grab live you notice that those virus were interested in that spread property so we use their profile and say OK buyers from this area will have the $2 million house are downsizing and interested in moving to a Long Branch to this type of building so we use that profile and expanded around where those two buy two buyers live and basically pull the data and target specifically those people there so that's another way of using it even though the property is in New Jersey where we're talking the the the buyer for those properties and you can also go into your MLS and see the last year where like let's say you're working in Ridgewood you're working in Ridgewood so you see where everybody came from yeah you see when it's closed it'll give you the the town this you know if they're all coming from Manhattan say or Brooklyn or Bronx or you know any Long Island or wherever they're coming from you could do the same thing You could go there and see you know that area who's who's there so we used to pull this I used to pull this myself in the data from from from the data from the MLS where every year we track like for example Richland right well how if you have a million plus house in Ridgewood where are the buyers coming up for that house and surprisingly when you pull you know 56 years worth of data and compare it every every year the data was very similar 2020 I can tell you between twenty to 25% are going to be people from Manhattan between 10 and 20 to 20% are going to be people from Hoboken Jersey City and Hudson County monkeys there so and and that specific for that property you can build a profile like this and say OK this is I want to target buyers for my listing you know and and go more into details and then there was every Year 5 to seven buyers were international buyers who come directly from out of the country by specifically individual those are impossible to tell you because they were like very mixed like England Germany a lot everywhere But you know you could find trends like this where you can spend your money more wisely to target and now you even have with the you know what the the Zillow showcase is so they have a report similar to this for when you showcase the listing they will show you within your portal where are the people who are looking at your listing where they are that way you can also if you want to target them same thing you can use you know digital ads you can pull data from here you can do you know social media different you know quarters to target specifically buyers who you're listening now it hasn't been used as much because the market's still too hot here like anyhow to put itself quickly but ultimately when the market balance out those will have more value especially knowing how to use them and have more value for sure what about in Manhattan I know it isn't up to date on Edgewater has a problem getting they don't have all the data for the large apartment building but in Manhattan is it the same way how is their their information well so the so just from a map point of view you know there could be 100 units in this building So what it's pulling you know I don't really know Yeah it doesn't this it's not a good portal for to use for urban areas and if you want to pull like Hoboken you know Jersey City buildings we actually the issues we had is we used to we tried to pull so we noticed that when you put the zip code there actually Angela noticed this is when you put the zip code there you're able you're getting more data than if you go on and drawing something specifically or just putting the name of the town you know so we noticed that it's it's more complete when you put the zip code but it's it's still missing a lot of data especially the big buildings so it's not well designed if you want from that point of view to get the data for all the buildings I think just because it's it's built national and it's built you know more for markets that are you know single family houses so if you're in a single family house we're trying to build your farm in a single family market that's a good portal to use but if you're going to use building you know especially markets like you know Hoboken Jersey City New York City it's not going to be it's not a software to use because it doesn't have complete data you can rely on it will still pull like this one here is a unit number number a 4 like it'll it'll still pull something but it it not fully not maybe not as accurate as it would for like Sandy said a single family neighborhood there are software you can where you can still buy the data if you're in a specific data for example in Hoboken or in Edgewater or and you're targeting specific buildings there are software where you know you can get the data but it's going to cost money so it's going to cost about if you're able to build a farm of about 5000 contacts it will cost about 10 cents 10 to $0.15 per per per contact which is where they forgot the name of it but like there's a lot of if you google like main this really in the country there's like 4 big data companies where you can buy data from but and they can I mean there are some filters that you can use in some filters you can like for example if you want to target you know high end then you can target people who own a specific type of a car maybe a Royce choice maybe Ferrari maybe so you can they have filters like this that you can use to specifically you know narrow down your data based on what you're looking to get but I will send you a friend I don't remember we haven't done data you know multiple data sometime now we get the ones we have already Yeah we but we pulled literally the whole state of New Jersey wasn't the full state maybe there's a couple of counties within pool because we're not there but we pulled all of this we pulled Westchester Rockland County so we use a lot of the data to to you know try to generate also opportunities for you guys which will take us into the next subject What do you think you all can do It





OK so tonight everybody pick a territory pick a farm pick a circle market let's do a circle market find a house that just came on the market that sold find a house that sold in the areas that you like to work you you have to do cresco right Oh you're on it now 0 God yes OK so we'll work on it a little bit tomorrow but so everybody do that you do it too and come tomorrow so you can share it let's do it again and and then we'll we'll see how we go OK did anybody download ACSV as we were doing It the excel file of all the properties





-------------------------------------
You wish you can have it when you started out in real estate I had the Yellow Pages guys and some of you don't even know what the Yellow Pages is a okay so we're going to switch gears now from Remind to UP City so so now I'm all messed up that's OK so OP City is a lead generation It's a place in Austin TX where there's a bunch of people there and when a lead or a consumer goes on realtor .com and they click request a tour they put all their information in and and now they get connected to one of these people sitting in Austin TX they chit chat for a little bit and that person connects the lead to you thank So before we get more into it just basic so it is lead generation service there is a referral fee there's a 40% referral fee on all and any transactions done with the client any family friend or person you meet through this client also 40% referral fee for those transactions for two years whether they buy one house in two years or ten houses in two years that's 40% to obstee on all transactions OK there's also mandatory training you have to go through mandatory training and you know if you're interested you know reach out to us and we'll get you set up with that but kind of jumping ahead OK OK Oh yeah alright so so what's important on opposite I So what's important on Odd City what if that's bothering you to help I guess I'm just kind of used to that Kill it That happens to me all the time i'm doing something and something shows up on the screen I can see everybody looking at it I know how you feel I just like OK OK OK so what's important obviously it's a lead generation service so your conversion is important but besides conversion something that Opcity really looks at is your met with weight how many people you're meeting and how quickly you're meeting them so updating the system when you're part of this obstity program is very crucial because based on your updates the Opcity is now predicting things So so with your Met With Ray is also your answer rate how often and how quickly you answer the phone calls So what happens is you know you have the OP City app downloaded it'll come to your phone and kind of like a push notification and you'll click it and it'll say claim or skip always claim the lead don't skip the lead and don't not answer the phone always claim the lead even if you don't want it if you don't want it wait until the very last second still claim it but it likely went to somebody else because obstinate wants to see that you're active that you you want these leads that they're sending So how how many times you answer and how quickly you answer is something that they're measuring as well as how many people you're meeting and how long it takes you to OK so if OK so like I said when the call comes you really should answer it what if you're in a place where you can't answer the phone well if you know you're gonna be in a place where you can't answer the phone like a showing or meeting like this or shower 'cause they used to come in and during your shower time yes what showering eating sleeping all the time you can put yourself on snooze or do not disturb and you can do this for from two hours up to two months So depending on how long you need a break So yes OK all right now once you have the don't release the lead you can there's an option on obstetrics to release or reject don't do that if you receive one lead and then you reject it you're now your reject rate is 100% and Obstetrics doesn't like to see that and they they won't want to send you anymore you can start releasing leads when you kind of have a pipeline going when you've got some people in there and then different statuses and you know some of the people who maybe you know maybe they're not going to use you or maybe they're not answering them You can release them but your first couple of leads don't do that because then they'll stop sending you leads OK so and one thing I want to talk about is answering the phone so when you answer the phone you'll you'll say and I'm sure they go over this in the training you'll have a script that you need to stick to and the very first thing you'll say is you'll make the appointment you get you get the lead as soon as you click connect and then you'd say you know like hello like there's a person there's the lead on the other side of your phone so so you start off with what we call the A or making the appointment you'll say hi this is Angela with Christy's I see you're interested in 123 Main Street what date and time works for you to take a look at the home Something who all in one shot that's how you will answer the phone when you get these connection calls Don't say hi how are you How can I help you because then you're losing control of the conversation and you don't want the client to then go Oh yeah II got a question I got a back story 'cause they all do and so you want to you want to take control of that conversation you want to start off with your A hi introduce yourself where you're from you want to see 123 Main Street great what date and time works for you to get to take a look at the home keep it short keep it simple 3 minutes get off the phone OK so so recap You go through your training you get on the program They send you a lead you claim it on your phone it becomes an actual connection call you do your what I call a your appointment you ask hi when would you like to see your house they respond perfect you hang up the phone you make the appointment you meet them When you're done with your meeting you're going to go into your system and you're going to update your app met them you're going to add notes and all that jazz even though you haven't met them yet you still put met them keep that in mind Well in this scenario you have met them because you you made the appointment Is that something you're telling people to do OK so let's back up a little bit yeah I think you went through it a little bit quickly Keep in mind Angela is the first time she's doing it like she's doing a great job I'll get better I probably know you're doing better Does anyone know what Elite is to start with You guys know what Elite is yes OK so let's talk about specifically this portal which is obsolete like Chevy's owned by Realtor.com so if a client goes on Rita.com and do they look at a property that they want to see right they click on contact the agent So what this is doing is instead of this lead or this person being in touch with an agent directly they have this middle band that's called obstacle like you said it's a group of people sitting in Austin Texas and I will pick up the phone for the one that currently can't contact agent and they will pre screen the client OK as they're pre screening the client in front of them they're building a profile for that client based on what they say OK what's your name what you're looking for i'm looking for a house in Ridgewood so what's your budget my budget is 2 million what's your time frame my time frame is 6 to eight months all that information is being entered in the computer and there's an algorithm who's like OK trying to decide who's the perfect agent for that specific card right They know the client's looking at Ridge with their budget is 2 million they're looking to buy within the next six months they don't have a house to sell they know they have a kid then why they want to be there because they're they like the schools or they you know they whatever reason that they want to be there but they build a profile for that specific client in that book now the algorithm has to decide which agent in that market you know will get the clock right so and that's what we're talking about here is that OK up city is going to be build that profile and and put the client in that portal and the algorithm is going to decide which agent phone is going to ring now obviously everybody wants that $2 million buyer I can tell you probably everybody in that building will take that buyer today if they have that opportunity now you know what how do you position yourself to get that client why would the algorithm decide to give you the client not the agent sitting next to you today right so there are rules that will dictate why your phone will ring and why not someone else's phone will ring That's what Angela was talking about is that OK what are those rules one is the most important one is conversion So what does that mean means that you actually took the client and sold them a house right that's what we conversion is that you get the leads and you basically you know transacted with that client so he got that 40% referral fee from you that's considered conversion because you close that deal so that's number one probably the most important one out of all the rules to to remember number two what as I mentioned is meeting so basically the system is going to check OK if I give you one 100 leads how many of them you end up meeting and that's just meeting is meeting within 12 days so the algorithm is trying to measure how many clients are able to meet within 12 days why it's built on a on a statistics by the NAR and national institution of Realtor that if you're able to meet the client within the first 12 days your chances of converting that client will increase by 19% 90 so it's really all about me so it's really built the system is built it's like OK you can have a great conversation with someone on the phone but guess what they're not buying a house with you just because you have a great conversation if you're not able to meet our client chances are they're not buying a house they may not even remember you in like you know after a week even if you had a great conversation before so the key here in this program is not just about OK you picked up the phone had a great conversation the key is make sure that you meeting them and meeting them is in 12 days so both friend and Angel were talking about that when do you change that status in the app So what we do because it's time sensitive for the algorithm right so the algorithm is measuring if you're meeting the client within 12 days So what we do is as soon as you have a confirmed appointment with the client on the phone you go in your app and say OK change that status to met that you're actually going to meet them right so once you have a confirmed appointment you change the status to back why because it's time sensitive for the algorithm that you they know that you're actually gonna meet the body right so the sooner you do it the better it is for you for your score think about it this way I tell you like you're playing a video game literally this is how this works because your actions with the clients what you're doing and what you're updating in your portal is what's gonna dictate what leads you're gonna receive are you gonna get that $2 million buyer or they're gonna send you that you know $200,000 pull up lead that they have and your actions in the system is what's dictating what's what did you receive So number one conversion number two make sure that you meet people within 12 days number three when your phone rings so you have an app on your phone and when the system they're sending you that client they usually sending it one agent at a time so they're going to send it to you for three seconds you don't answer they're going to send it to another agent as well you can still take it because it's still on your app but they're sending it to more and more agent as the time moves on so really what you're trying to do is basically claim as soon as possible the lead so they are checking if you are claiming because when you get the lead you have two options at the bottom one it says claim or skip and they're checking are you actually trying to claim the lead OK if you're skipping it's hurting your score is coming down remember by always that that video game your score is coming down when you skipping if you're totally ignoring the lead that's even hurting you more So what you want to do is you want to claim as many of these as possible think about it this week the system is trying to see how good of an agent you are right but in order for you to show how good of an agent you are you have to have a leap if you have no lead you can show that you're you can convert right the lead if you don't have a client from our city you can show them you can convert it so that means that you have to claim leads so if you're not claiming delete that's hurting you as well big time so make sure you're claiming every lead they send you especially in the beginning because in the beginning they can they can send you one lead if you're not trying to claim it they may not send you another one that's how that's how trick they can be So using that feature that as I mentioned the snooze button is becomes very critical especially in the beginning So what does smooth button do is if you put yourself on snooze you're telling the algorithm don't send me any lead I see right now send it to someone else so your phone will not ring you will not get any lead when you are on snooze the 2nd but you can put yourself on snooze for a month and then in an hour later say now I change my mind i'm good and then you go back and reactivate it and you're back in the algorithm OK so keep that in mind you control that time when you're in when you're out we had one very very successful agent on the team who actually use this strategy to really do you know a ton of business from this portal and what he did is he basically would unsnose himself actually first he converted a bunch of leads and then his his core was very high and then he snooze himself where the system would not send him anything and then when he's available he would answer take a constant again right away why because now his core was locked in high because they're not sending him anything that he's missing he also knows that got the lead right away and snooze again So he's all the time snooze he only unsnoozed when he wants a car things that crime and then snooze himself right away so that's you know a strategy that this this this agent that did really well so he would get all the time all the million plus dollar million dollar more buyers but only by getting the client snooze again work with that buyer try to meet them you know and then you know move them in the pipeline so when you say move them in the pipeline is like OK initially there's a lifespan of a client when you meet them as a lead initially you have that kind of conversation with them then OK you're trying to meet them and you meet them once you meet them your goal would be to try to work with them so which means that we try to show them more than that initial house that they inquired about now once you show them more than one house the key is to get them to you know find the right house and submit an offer on that house and then the next step was get that offer accepted and then go on the contract and close so this is a lifespan the different metrics if you want that's been measured for the life of the lead and they call in in this business they call it like the funnel So you can get like 10 phone calls you're gonna make seven appointments you're gonna meet 5 clients are you gonna work with three of them you close you know one or two right so that's the idea of like what the funnel is in general is like it starts with 1st how many calls you get but then you know what Angela you know took it the next step is like OK once you get that phone call how is it that you what can you do to maximize your chances of meeting was the conversation the ball on the phone should be you're meeting the client so that's why you're when you're opening the phone the ball should be you're asking for the appointment as the first question because you want to make sure that you're maximizing your chances of you know being successful and being successful means that you're meeting the car yeah for example this happened to me yesterday was the 1st one came in and I wasn't sure how to hit it didn't show claim and now I know how to get to that but I did hit claim when I found it and it said it was too late somebody else you know they passed it So did that work against me no it doesn't it doesn't count against you You try to claim it's just that I was second or third on the line so that's that's really the perfect way to do it sometimes you're going to be busy and you know you're going to open it and then they'll send you something that you really don't want like let's assume they give you a client like a tab for a $1000 rental in Mama two hours to do so that's why I won't even make the money I might even do anything So you're like you you tend to say OK I don't want that fine but you cannot reject it so the best way to do is wait a minute or two maybe last few seconds and then let someone else take it because remember other agents after you are getting that same lead so hopefully someone else claimed it and so when you click on claim is going to tell you 0 sorry someone else to be thank you because you didn't really want it but you always have to claim every single lead so we just want one thing in the portal They have different levels you know of of access if you want for agents and what they do is based on your experience so based on how many years you've been licensed based how many transactions you closed they would give you different access in the portal so some of you know the experience agents they would allow you to control the price point let's say I only want leads at 500 500,000 or more which means the property value is at 500,000 more or you can say I only want these specifically in only those ten zip code So you can select the zip code only you want it but that feature is only available for what they call you know experienced agent so when you're invited to join the program you're asked a bunch of questions you asked how long you've been licensed how many transactions you close the last you know last year what's the dollar amount of those transactions if we give you a client how many times you're going to follow up with them so they're going to ask you a bunch of questions and based on your answers they're going to say OK you're either an experienced agent or an emerging agent So if you're an emerging agent you do not get to control the zip codes but they would allow you to do is they would allow you to set one center zip code and the radius around that zip code up to 60 miles it could be from five miles all the way to 60 miles and you can say OK my because all of you are from different markets all of your Ridge some of you are in Hoboken some of you in Edgewater so then you can say OK you know my I live around this town and this is the market where I'm going to work so you can say Edgewater and you can say I want a 5 mile radius around Edgewater so obviously that will take you to New York City they probably won't give you New York City leads but you know you can draw that specific area and then they will give you leads in that radius as an emerging agent so most of you are newly licensed with probable put you in that bucket as emerging agent but once you close three transactions it could be 3 rentals they will move you up automatically to experience so then they will allow you to select the zip code select the price point of view leads so at that point let's say I hit claim and and I was doing its needed OK I haven't seen this good on my screen on my screen it will show the price of the fights I've been looking for where they're from It should have showed you that when you before you play it I did it too fast and I wasn't ready yeah so you you before you claim it you will show you what area the point is show you what price they're looking at and their time frame so you can select you see that up front before you play I mean I feel like regardless remember especially if you're experiencing regardless of what comes out on the screen you selected those criteria so take it because even if even as an emerging agent we should take anything because we want to prove yourself in the beginning they will show you the area it's not going to show you the specific house but then you can you know once you claim it we will tell you say you want and then you will see the information on your phone OK I got it sorry we'll have to check Are you going to change the full tunes or just like yeah you can always yeah you can always update it we can choose like a radius exactly like the accurate question by 1020 miles I'm just 60 miles you can go Yeah II would suggest to actually start small because remember especially as an emerging agent they're gonna give you what what other agents need doesn't give you leads that other agents initially because remember they have the algorithm is gonna decide OK if it's a $2 million buyer in Ridgewood you already know it only was in Christie's there's like 516 who already converted $2 million Now they say they're going to claim it because they're going to see a $1000 rental and I have no then that's going to come down to you because you know kind of the way you said no to it and I came to you so basically you end up with you need to make sure that you perform by using the client so one of the biggest mistake we see with with the clients and agents is too big one agents some agents they try to create reportedly OK I can tell you I was taught this when I started real estate as well that you try you have to create reports from do not do that with online why because you can have great conversation with them guess what make a conversation only about making very easy don't do not even check if the property is available They asked me right because that's typically what you should be let me see it's available if you're checking the property is available automatically giving the message to the client that you're not I did think when they clicked on contact agent that they're contacting this local experts who already knows this house who's gonna have them with this house so the 2nd they click on contact lesion you tell them which prop do you want to see oh let me see if it's available and then you open up you interrupt the conversation open up the MLS to see if it's available what street again 0 you must already the clock I can guarantee you that they already in their market so ultimately regardless of what they asked you about Hey you see the coming in at 123 matrix is it available yeah it's available when do you want to see do not even look that outlook at the MLS to see if it's available then once you finish with the client say hey you know I'll I'll call you in a minute just to confirm you know that the seller or this time works for the seller that was the listing agent right let me make sure this time works for the seller I'll get back to you in a few minutes then you close the phone and then go open up at that time the MLS to find out if it's available to see tomorrow at 2:00 and then you call the client back or text them back so OK we'll confirm I'll see you tomorrow at 2:00 Does that make sense for everybody and if it's already under contract well if it's under contract ideally you know you want to find out well you want to find another house before you call them back that's similar to what they called about and then you that you can get them into tomorrow to come so ideally something that's not on the market So what can you do there is like a list of exclusives in the MLS New Jersey MLS has a separate page with all the exclusive listings that are not published published or published rather on the on the market that really other public doesn't know that is coming for sale This is where I would start would you start with that list and then give the client back say hey you know this house already took an offer you know but you know what if the deal falls apart I'll keep you in mind does that work for you you know you told me that you're available tomorrow 2:00 I have another house I want to show you it's not on the market actually but it's coming soon on the market but I can get you in I just talked you know to the owner we can get you in tomorrow at 2 o'clock are you available to come see what can you tell me where is it what's what's about well it's a colonial the similar is the other house you wanted to see has also a pool you know similar taxi blah blah blah you know what's the address i'm not a big fan of giving them the address because especially if it's an exclusive because you don't know what they're going to do with it what I would say is OK you know it's in the same neighborhood let's meet at the corner of the land and main and then it's a few minutes from there you know you know the the you know this house they required about just around the corner you can meet at the Main and Glen and then we can go from there that's what you know probably would tell them and then they know from there to ultimately see that so just make sure you do your due diligence I mean everything I just mentioned is probably more advanced than just the basic stuff where you see house open MLS go show it to them 'cause there's more work to do so make sure you run it by your manager on what you're doing you know sometimes there's more paperwork you need to sign before you're you're going and show them that property to make sure that you have guidance you can reach out to me also to make sure that you have the right guidance for it yeah so if they read if II get the need there for the property that they were looking for they don't you know something happens with the property is not available so do I still hold and I get them another house do I still hold your program yeah well yeah yeah it's actually there's a this is another misconception is agent think that OK you get a call about 123 Main Street you go show the house and then they buy the house you know let me share with you the real numbers 99% again nineteen nine percent of the clients you're gonna get inquiring about 123 Main Street then I'm buying 123 Main Street So really this program it's not about you going and selling multiple is you going in front of that you know that client at 123 Main Street to sell your services what value proposition you bring to the table what do you do why would the buyer work with you that's what you need to be able to answer during that so it's an interview that's how this really the mindset you need to have is you have that 15 20 minute interview with that client and really what you're going to do and say on that interview is what's going to you know help you or not get that going to work with you I have a question because this I get this question all the time Using that process in that dialog is fine but what if the the the lead says yeah I'd like to see it but I need to know what the taxes are before I come absolutely i'm very happy to have you know I'm actually currently on an appointment As soon as I'm done here I'll get back to you as you know I have a few listings currently on the market you know I don't give you the wrong number you're going to tell me it's this this number but I'll call you with the more exact number a few minutes OK so any question the client has that you do not know it could give you time to look up you know the worst thing you want to do is give the wrong no I know you don't want to interrupt the conversation and open the MLS you always say you know let me give you a call back i'm actually done almost done here with my appointment I'll get back to you in a few minutes you know can I call you back in a few minutes and then take the question of what's your question go find out and call it back you don't want to the worst thing you you want to do is try to interrupt the conversation to open it at the open the MLS or try to find out at that moment or say oh I don't know let me ask the the listing agent that's the worst thing you want to do because a lot of those clients calling they think you are the listing agent and the 2nd you tell them you're not chances are you already going to lose What do agents do with leads that are absolutely not that they can't surface in this area or that they're absolutely not qualified what should they do with that so not qualified again you never reject the lead or release a lead the reason why we don't release a lead is is the algorithm looks at it as a percentage right if you have A 100 leads and you released one OK how many did you convert you converted four 5 OK that's OK that's an OK ratio but when you go releasing one lead and you only have 5 in your pipeline that's you only one out of every five that's 20% that's OK this algorithm is gonna kind of try to slow you down So what typically at all agents is that claim as many as you can in the beginning meet with as many as you can do not release anybody just put them on our trip say oh nothing new is the client for now OK not every just so that you know that the people have like a good understanding of what's the expectation The top people who work leads they will convert between 15 to 20% of the lead which means there is still 80 bad leads for every twenty that are good that's the best people on average is probably closer in probably in you know five six percent range so your for every hundred leads 5 will close or five will convert which means you're going to have 95 battles whether they don't qualify or they're not serious or they start in this market they end up buying somewhere else or whatever reason 95% of them they're not converting but that's the concept you need to have you know before you even pick up any form even before joining the program it's you have to go through all those 95 in order to get to the five on average so keep that in mind so that's what the one who doesn't convert I would just you know keep them in the pipeline And in one of the rules also is you have to update every client that you have once every 7 days and once an update you anything you can put in this OK I didn't talk to the client this month or this week rather right because once every seven days I didn't talk to a client this week that's considered an update OK or nothing new this week whatever just anything you put in there is considered an update but you have to do it forever for every client once every seven days if you do not they will send you an email say hey you told us as part of joining this program that you gonna give us an update once every seven days you haven't given us an update you become the language and they will not be sending you any leads so if you get that going but I mean I think it shows in red or something they'll they'll tell you when you're late if you're if you are the 8th day you forgot to contact and then you contacted them upon that does that does that movie up again or that no you once you become delinquent you have to call them yeah literally get on the phone with the support team so you don't want to I can even want it back that's why you have to time block you have to put that 7th day in your schedule and it's I would put it 6 days even me I cannot reactivate you you have to call the they they when you talk to support they're going to ask well did you because sometimes what happens is most agents that become delinquent they don't they're not delinquent for one day they're delinquent because they forgot the updates and then they forget about it and they don't do anything for months and next thing you know when you go want to go back hey what happened to this opposite and then you go back to reactivated We need to know did you transact with any of the client no I didn't OK did you where are you with each one they can ask you for an update and then they say OK why were you delinquent I went on vacation or I forgot whatever and then they reactivate you at that time so if you snooze you still have to update i'm on snooze right now to 145 so I can but I can change that by hitting the button just saying even people I know people that have thought if they snooze for a month 'cause they're going away or they're going on vacation they don't think they have to update you still have to update 0 yeah update your oh really One of the I'll get you a question one SEC one of the things in there so you can see one of the cool parts actually is when you go log in it will show you all the top agents who closed how much business they close it you have a few Christie's agents that close over 50 transactions you know within these portals and they will show you the dollar amount even of the total transactions in there so you'll see literally who are the top people in Christie's if it's someone has not increased these it will show you just the name of the brokerage so you don't know who the agent name is but you know someone had whatever brokerage close X amount of business in there so it's very often where you see who closed what but one of the 1 of them I guess good habits to have 'cause you gonna see you can have hundreds and hundreds of leads in there very quickly especially if you perform well up front so the the key is to make sure that you're you know give yourself probably like 1/2 an hour to an hour every week for the week to say to go through all the updates and that's what a lot of you know the successful agents is like they they know you know X you know might say Monday between 12 and 1:00 that's all I'm doing i'm not doing anything else i'm focusing on updating all the leads in my portal to make sure that you know I did everything I need to do and but because if you have 100 and you know one you have to update today another one tomorrow or the one after then you're only doing that and it becomes very quickly you know not manageable so you want to make sure that you organize yourself this way so that once a week one time frame you set up for everybody and then you're good to go you have a questions



You sell the house to the client it becomes your market as close they ask you what's the address of the property what's price point how this Commission you're making 'cause they're getting paid based on the Commission you're making you know 40% of whatever Commission that you're making they're getting it so they're going to ask you those questions close there's no more up there you could do it's closed it's done it's paid I think I think she meant though during the transaction so she would say you know I didn't know Still under contract you know every week right every 7 actually do that like I get let's say RJ got a lead yesterday but then he's on pause so he doesn't get another one until next week maybe I know he's going to get more but as soon as he so when you get the ball in the same time frame is what I'm saying so when you are no no you can get leads you know unlimited amount of leads you can get a ton right away it's not he's not doesn't mean he's not getting anything till next week because he snoozed it so if he snoozed it then then he's not going to you know he's not going to get anything during that snooze. My point is if you guess one this week he snooze that he goes away and then he unsooses it and next week at a certain date so how do they get them all on the same day to do his reporting you know you get them randomly they have a value list they say it's not as once you're once you do the update today for all of them the time reset for all of them for 7 days OK that's so regardless of when you receive them once you do the update the time clock starts again for 7 days yeah so once you do all of them today then for seven days you don't have to do all of them that's why that's why doing it once a week specific time one that you just got two days before might be updated in two days but then we'll catch up exactly like they also they'll reset all of them and at the same time when you when you are updating them so that's why you should update all of them at the same time so that way you know you have one week from today you don't have to do anything there's a really special benefit to this too because you'll go back to your office is and I'm going to tell you you know Sammy knows it the people are going to tell you don't bother with it it's horrible but I'm also going to tell you that there are loads of agents in this company linda being one that is doing great in making lots of money and then those age those leads after two years become a part of your funnel for the future if they list their house in 3 years or two years and one month if they they're friends buy a house whatever they're yours if you nurture them properly after two years after two years Linda actually it's like I said you when you log into the app you can see a ranking of all agents and their business you can see Linda specifically how many transactions she closed what's the dollar amount of it she's one of the top performers on the on the team in a number of transactions she's done a ton of it so you can see in there it's open to everybody to see you know what's how much business you can do from this portal but it's it's it's all about you know learning you guys most of you are new here in the business it's all about learning the good habits right away which is for example what's a good habit is like don't pick up the phone say hey how how can I help you today OK because by doing that you're giving total control to the buyer and guess what Chances are slimmer of you making that appointment already you want to make sure you control that conversation and that's what I mean like one of the good habit is make sure you take control of the conversation make sure it's like an update conversation that's a positive exciting remember the client is excited to see a property right and you want to keep that excitement you want to say hey how you doing today so you kind of want to make sure that it's that you keep that excitement on the phone you know and and translate it into an appointment and permit them to show them house And then then the next is Fern will talk to you about what your value proposition what you're bringing to the table as an agent why would the buyer want to work with you why not with someone else that's another question that you need to make sure you answer before you even get any lead because you know what's the point of view going showing them a house if you know 99% of them going to buy the house it's really about what value you're bringing to the table and it's all about selling your services to that client that's what's important you've all done your value proposition right right right I have one more thing to add about the

Like oh they're they're you know they're their budgets too low they're not qualified they'll they'll make more money they'll save more money and then eventually they'll get to the point where they are ready to go and they're ready to buy and to the point maybe it's two years later and now you don't owe a referral fee but you kept that lead in your pipeline and you stayed in touch with this person and now you have another conversion I have a question so you said after two years we don't have to share a referral fee so let's say I get a lead and they end up buying something great and then a year later they want to sell it do I still owe if it's within that yes so if you get a lead today is November 5th 2025 Yes if you get a lead today any transaction you do it from November 5th 2025 to November 5th 2027 so if they buy the house let's say you close in February you're still and then they go to sell it and February of 2027 you still owe referral fee until November how does opposite he know that they've got honestly they've got a team of like they're following you they'll probably notify you No we've had you do need to you should be open and honest you know you as soon as you list it it's going to pop in there it's going to be there right let me let me tell you one story we had one agent of ours actually she is in that office I won't say names or anything one day I got a call from Op City and say hey we have a problem i'm like OK what's the problem there is one agent of yours closed 5 transactions and did not disclose any of them to us OK what are those 5 they send me exactly the 5 transactions I called that agent and said OK they're saying that you called on 5 with obscurity clients is that true Oh yeah I forgot to update show them over $30,000 in referral fees she paid because she was getting business from them and so she did but so they and asked I asked him was like well how did you guys find out have an early team of investigators to determine but mostly what they do is they they check they check for the clients they check their social media they bought a house they said OK did they take a picture or they mentioned any agent who they buy houses turned out to be one of them actually they sent me literally the screenshot of the client's Facebook was saying congratulations and one of our agents standing on the picture with them so they are really they can track everything and that's not just them really I have one other portal that will not mention'cause that's not our our our point here they literally are able to tell you who The Who the client bought a house was you know and literally to a point where even if it's not any of our agent even if they bought it with someone else they're not able to tell you where and what happened exactly and they literally give you will give you details on how many times the client even met because they own so many different software's out there so they are able to you know Zillow owns for example showing that they know every time you make an appointment with the client to show them something they already know that they are able to track who sold them the house but how many houses you showed them and what end up happening was every shop they're literally data is like everything today...

What do they call them when they're just Angelica they're paying thousands and thousands of dollars a month for their bill up three four thousand dollars a month without knowing that they're going to be reimbursed without knowing they're going to make a deal you're going to go over how to join how to join OK I just want to bring up one more point though that is important because this is another question you get somebody who decides they can't work in Bergen County but they 'd like to work in they're going to go up to Connecticut instead you can't refer that person A lot of people think they can refer those leads that they're giving you they are referrals right so they're referring the business to you they're referring a client to you cannot refer a referral it's not yours to refer let's say this way right so if the client comes to you and that you can't service them you can call support their support obstacle say hey I will need a mind they're looking now in New York and not licensed in New York can you give it to somebody in New York so we tried initially to work within our networks We cover a lot of the markets where the crime comes in absentee is not comfortable because we're trying to refer the client within our company so they're not happy with this even any referral call them and then they will help you find an agent for that client so that you can still work the New Jersey market or your market that you're an expert in and then have another agent cover that market OK so you've got a good question is it OK how do I join yes we didn't talk about this probably very important so number one is make sure that first of all you're interested in this I understand this really well what we will do is I will email you a training to do 1st so it's more it goes more into details about what we talked about today just how the app works how the leads come in all of that and people in Austin TX what they're doing so all of that will you know it's about in 1 hour you can do it as a webinar or on demand or live yeah so you can do that and then there are more detailed trainings about the script about all that if you want to do it we don't require you to do it it's up to you if you want to do it we require that first training so that you're you know not going blind into this because it's really your performance in the system that's gonna dictate what leads you receive so you really don't know if it was you or someone else who asked me how much how many of these trainings I need to do there is like a ton of them I said well listen if you can do as many as you can that would be great because then you're just going to build especially for someone like who is you in the business you kind of want to build that skill of like OK what you say on the phone what do I not say on the phone right we never talk about financing on the phone never talk to us about if they have an agent on the phone so a lot of things that you need to kind of learna

Responsible for that part that's all we have to invite you to join the program I have one more question then the new what they're not new to the laws about the buyer I was just about to turn that up well something just changed and and there was a warning that when you meet the you know so what's been happening with these leads is people meet them and have them sign it right before they go into the house That looks like too much pressure it's going to come where it's going to change no So what we do is we we try since the law changed in August of 2024 in New Jersey when it's law where the governor Governor Murphy signed the law where now any buyer who wants to see a property you know to make an appointment to see a property well they're not going to an open house they have to sign an agreement to go into the house so we tried a lot since then we tried a lot of different methods to introduce this to the body You tried longer term shorter term all kind of different agreements right ideally what works best is this no buyer is going to buy a house with you if they don't feel that you are the right agent for them so nobody's going to feel forced to work to work with you if they don't feel that you are you have the you know the knowledge the capability to guide them through the this very expensive process that they have to go through probably the more one of the more expensive transactions they're going to do in their life So what does that mean it means that really you can if they sign an agreement with you for 6 months and tomorrow they will be like I don't like this Asian I don't want to work with them it's impossible they're going to email and say listen I don't want to work with you and they're going to go work with someone else so really what the program is about and this is the general how to introduce this fire agency agreement what we found is the best thing to do is never mention it on the phone go show up to the house and then as you before you go into the house you know you text them even the link to the law And as the client walks in and say hey nice to meet you by the way have you are you familiar with the lawn in New Jersey that you're required to sign an agreement oh no I'm not familiar OK well I just texted you the link to the log in August 2024 signed it well we're not any buyer who wants to see how they're required to sign this agreement you know since we don't know each other I made this agreement only for one day and only for this property we're going to see together today at the end of the day this agreement will expire so that way if you decide tomorrow do you want to work with someone else you know then you don't have to let me know even that you have you want to work with someone else you have the freedom to go select anybody else this agreement is only limited to this house we're going to see today and only till end of day today so you make your you make limited so you know the end of day today and by the way you don't have to worry about compensation the salary is compensating on this problem usually they sign no problem because it's only limited to one house one one day so sign you go in and then you make it about your value proposition not about that agreement anymore so so opcity doesn'ta...





No it's up to you to do it and now a lot of agents do this differently this method works best with online leads because remember it's not someone who referred them to you and said hey you know work with friends she's the best agent you're going to get right they don't know who Fern is the next thing you know they showed up they clicked on one button they're standing in front of her in front of the house right so that's that's the mindset that they have so it's not really then they have zero loyalty different it's all about how firm she's you know is going to prove herself to them during that interview during that showing is gonna dictate whether they decide to work with her or not and it's not really an agreement that's gonna change anything that's why we know this we tried we tried ages some agents tried to at the first meeting time make them sign for 6 months and we noticed that some buyers will freak out because you know there's a lot of exclusive language in this agreement and they were like wait a second like I'm stuck with this agent but I don't like her and then next thing you know they they free they call the agent or get an attorney to poll agent and then they were i'm not working with you I don't want anything to do with you I don't and then it's it's even worse so really it's all about making sure that you guys are you know showing value and the reason why someone why would someone want to work with you you should focus on that rather than on the agreement and that goes for any customer like we've gone over we did a whole thing on it Randy did a whole study you know all the new laws and everything with everybody so they know that it has to be done and it can you can do the 1 Day 1 showing one house you know it doesn't even have to be agency anyway so you want to I'm going to be your representative so I'm the one that's going to help you so you know good and then get one so we we have to be very careful though because according to Randy and I forgot her name who's you know works what's her name she works with the real estate Commission they're frowning on ages Evelyn frowning there may be something coming up very shortly they're frowning on ages demanding anybody sign something right before they show a house so I don't know how they're going to how we're going to deal with that that we may have to send them that link ahead of time for them to decide whether they want to sign it which would be kind of unfortunate because we've also noticed that when you send them you you all have zip form when you send them you know the form to E sign they're not signing it they're simply not so III don't really know how they're going to change like the law is you have to have this piece of paper signed to show the property but now you're going to restrict how you get the paper sent doesn't make any sense and also another change that may happen is that if you're called it hasn't happened yet so I don't even know I should bring it up but if you are the listing agent and you get a direct call on your listing that they don't have to sign people must have anything to do that's kind of strange Where can I find this contract in zip form Brandy went over it not the buyers agency agreement the one that I'm trying to show you this that's about yeah it's just a 2 page I just I'm just changing it saying that it's going to be active for this this one property and until the time frame and the big thing yeah there's a couple of if they object if not they may not i've had people not object at all I mean agents are telling me they have no problem at all signing it for months If at any time you're unhappy with me if it if you want me to continue working for you let's sign it for the period of time it's going to take my house if you're unhappy with me we can cancel at any time and you can put that in writing too Yeah there is a note section I think in the last page of it you can write if you want there's like any time you're not happy with me just email Also just a tip that from talking to people maybe keep a stack of them in your car Maybe you grab a call and they want to see this house in two hours and you run out of the house and you forget to print one keep a couple in your car so you have them readily available Yeah yeah once you get this sign you bring it to your office yeah you have to put it in your zip form it should be in your zip form yeah Oh yeah this is one of those compliance documents you have to have it especially if you close this link where's your buyer it doesn't have to be the zip form until you have to do a deal with it once you get paid in a fire yourself could they sign it on this yeah you can ideal way if you already know the client and you know they're gonna sign you know as I said you could send it to them in zip form when they sign it you have automatically a copy of it in the form already so then you're done So what we're talking about these leads that don't know you you don't knowl.


I'm sure some of your clients probably want them OK I think a good idea is to send not for this not for upsetting necessarily but for normal people that are I would send them the law the copy you have that in your paperwork a copy of the law and the form so they can see that you're not making it up you know it's definitely a law it's law everywhere by the way and don't be one of those agents that shows in the house anyway even if they don't sign it but follow the rules here Just assume they're going to find out and they're going to get in trouble so always have it some if let's say I'm using Opcity religiously and I become very successful with it or I get really busy I have a lot of clients and I don't have the time for it and I don't go on for a month is there like a penalty for that or not if you put yourself on that snooze OK as long as you can be on snooze for up to two months what Sammy said and I thought it was brilliant you know a person has a lead he sells them you know while he's working the lead he puts it on the snooze as soon as he finishes closing that he puts it open up again could only be instances up to two months Yeah I think it's one or two months Max yeah but then you can't right now I want snooze for one 45PM and I go off it get a call right now I want to hit it again one of the students again so I snooze for one hour up to 1 month oh it's 1 month yeah one month OK oh I'm sorry now I'm at 143 right so there's no penalty no that's how you say music is free from showering yeah food don't you know have a client We have a question so before you get the buyer's agency signed you have to do the CIS yeah that's what that just explained yeah you know dual age yeah don't forget your CIS that comes first and then the buyer's agency Anything else questions comments concerns thank you can you think they're going to try it Cool clarice I know you can do it the training by the way the hour is very informative you watch it twice and you really i'm pretty comfortable i'm not scared about that I was afraid of it because I had no idea what to do I hit the wrong things and you don't know if you don't answer you know you're in trouble And I know that script can seem a little daunting a little robotic hi when do you want to see this property it's proven that it works so there's a method to off cities madness and why they want you to say the things that they want you to say because it helps entice the client to want to meet how you handle yourself on the phone will determine if that client even wants to meet you So

Every time I got in the shower I literally got a wet thing to put my phone in a thing that would protect it Every time I got in the shower I got a call wow you know the best way to get over being scared of it is dive right in and do it I just watched the video takes it all takes all the nervousness away and you get yourself train yourself do these online on demand training as many as you can until you feel comfortable to understand it and then jump in even if you have to redo it do it as many times And they even said every after after you speak to the person I think it was an hour or 1/2 hour or an hour after they they said that they automatically send a thank you from you for taking the time to speak with us The key here too is depending on where these people are coming from I remember I said this 1,000,000 times if they're coming from out of our area where we have forced multiple where everybody has to put their listings and multiple New York City doesn't have that they may call somebody else they may call on a different listing so it's I think it's OK when you're calling them back to confirm the appointment to say listen by the way as long as you're coming out I have 3 I have I have access to all the listings would you like to see them right well yeah I mean the script is more more than just that first sentence ideally it's 3 sentences and one of them is well is there anything else you want to see while we are looking at this house because especially you know people coming from New York City they don't know that you can show them everything on the market so they don't know literally House that's available you can get t.... to make to see five different houses


Another house than just the initial one we call it and that way you capture you capture that customer because they don't have to make any more phone calls right yeah you don't want them you know we had one lead it was a $3 million buyer coming to Hoboken and the agent it was on Saturday the agent made an appointment to show them a property and then what they were done was the the showing and the client says oh thank you for showing us we're going to go meet this other agent now to see this other agent was like what Because that our agent forgot to ask him hey is there any other you know unit you want to see next thing you know they were going to see another unit in the building next door was another agent and it was instead of our agent showing them both units so now our agent had competition because now they're meeting another agent so they both had buyers agreements for that housing You can have multiple you have to buy it the buyer can have as many as they want the problem is they could be responsible if they're like for example if they have an agreement with both of you that are both valid that none of them expired they never gave me an email to terminate it You basically if you you sell them the house you can be entitled also to the information too so you get the buyer will be entitled to pay her as well so they can have as many as they want it's their problem they're selling all these agreements but again how is she going to know that the waterhouse was yours that's that's the factor there so yeah from a legality point of view So what would you do in a case like that you were showing up property and they said exactly that we're going to go into this other age because we have an appointment how would you handle it there's nothing what can you do you should have asked him that's that's the learn the lesson you learn is that you have to ask a museum you know the house you want to see you know I know you're coming from New York City and just doing a trip just for this property should I show you you know let's take a look at this other address as well so that way you're looking I can show you anything in the state of New Jersey that's it and if you have a New York license I can show you anything New York area So so make sure that's you know that's on that list of questions did you know that I can show you anything or was there anything that goes to question Jeff on page what was it 10 you know it was one of the things that you have to get you have to educate your client you have to let them know so there you guys are familiar with this is there anything else you want to see what do you like about this house that made you going to want to request a tour OK I was that's those are also good you know objective points to say on phone very helpful very because based on how they answer tho....tions will also determine how you how  But they like this house because of the amount of bedrooms the location the acreage whatever the case may be these are now filters you will use in your search when you're looking for other properties for that but you're not supposed to use that in the first call that's the wall back the 1st the the search and that she mentioned is the 3rd question we ask is that can you tell me because remember because on the first call you know you want to make sure you're making an appointment for that property that's number one and then but we don't know if that property is available could be not available so that's why we asked them is there anything else you want to see but also we ask someone can you tell me what is it that you like about that house what is it that triggered the call that's the 3rd question and really funny is is that the buyer will not tell you really what interested them in that house they're going to tell them what we want to be in this neighborhood we're looking for a colonial we're looking for this so really they're going to answer you the criteria is you know that they're interested and that's what you use to well that's like the questions that we use if we're an equal I thought from what you said originally is that we just when you want to see the property and then use that conversation when you call back OK right so let me just use it in the 1st conversation your 1st call you make the appointment you know great you know when you want to see this house OK Saturday at one great is there anything else you'd like to see while we're out I can show you anything in in New Jersey Oh yeah there was also this OK great or no that's OK and then alright perfect why what did you like about this house they'll tell you OK great we'll reach out to the seller or I'll reach out to the seller make sure saturday at one works three minutes you're done yeah yeah and then what I think we should add to that is either when they come aside from the paperwork you have to have signed is the turf people love it make sure where the cop coffee shop is I love that feature that is such a great featureo.


@Turf at platform research more. coffee shop. 


For that first whatever give them a little give me a little card for something towards the coffee it really works So when I go live on Pop City what is it like is it like a phone call screen like is that pop up that says like just like a regular push notification like when you get a text message you know it pops up city so so yeah but instead of like the green text bubble it'll be like the opposite icon and then when you click on the notification it'll open to the area and the price range and all that's the one thing that as I said before when we started today they didn't teach that one thing that you click on that notification I was I was looking how to get I don't know what to do and then I got back but just all you have to do is click on it so no it's not a phone call it's it's like a like a push notification and it gives you like the location it shows it shows a map the county or whatever yeah it's not the county it shows the town and it shows that the right here the time frame I tell you bottom you have to do about the flame I'd say this is how much that property is not they don't have a video that everything so it's a it's a setting on your phone right now if you have the latest iOS version it will automatically set it to that it stays on your screen but if you have an older version of the iOS you may have to go into your app notifications and make sure that they call it persistent so you make that notification persistent is that it stays on your screen until you remove it but it also will be available I know what you're talking about yeah I did that with my emails yeah so that if you if you because some of the settings automatically it sets it as temporary temporary so it shows up and then you want to persist OK but then three hours later when you go to click on it of course it's gonna be like sorry this went to somebody else so You want to claim every single especially in the beginning because remember if you have no leads you can prove yourself and if you miss one or two they may not send you anything So you don't want to get into the the that that situation where they're not sending you anything so on this on snooze yourself when you're available to take stuff in the beginning you know and and claim every anything they send you right away and then my recommendation is when you're showing houses to somebody else snooze yourself because it's really buyers don't like it when you're constantly being rude by taking calls when they're and this is like a script you have to be saying like if you're showing a home to a buyer like oh hi this is Angela with Chrissy's like it's not like you're like your mom you know something like that so so I'll finish with one last thing that I have to hide out we do have other programs that we work on the Legion side a lot of them actually are more rewarding than our city but we can get you into them right away because it's your performance that dictates if we're gonna if we're able to get to it so I guess like you said to entice you maybe to you know try absolutely the better you do enough city the more we're able now to reach out to hey you know we see how good you're working your leads in there would you be interested in opening you know one other portal to you and then where we have more opportunities so we have other partnerships with this App City and little dot com is only one of them but you know we want to open more doors for you so the more you're able the better you do is all these the more we're able to invite you to other programs that we just more more no so I'll tell you on the one of the biggest ones we work with the most position working we do hundreds of deals every year hundreds and the average price is on the $900 a $100 so same thing you have to pay referral fee but we have probably what like 67 agents or a little more in the company that will do over 18 transactions a year you know some of those programs so you know consider this as training you know but ultimately we want to graduate you into better programs with more rewards down the road so work hard try the best you can you know ultimately focus on what we mentioned today at the end of appointment meet as many kinds as possible for the value when you meet those clients and then repeat that again with other clients and ultimately once you convert you we want you to put to join other programs because we know you're going to do well in other programs I'm always looking for agents who want to work hard and want to make you know want to close my business so this is a hard working group this group So I get I get a lead in the in the pipeline We went on a meeting I got a report back every seven days until I release or reject we don't want to release or reject I guess when does it fall off on its own it doesn't OK So for the next two years this guy is on my list every seven days every seven days in the next 2 years whether on the news or not I'm not going to close it no but if I'll call him every day they could have won the lottery no but there are some situations like for example the client and you know they end up wanting to look somewhere else right or they may tell you 1 day hey listen we bought a house in New York OK let me have it ultimately what why we don't want to reject it is if you reject it you're telling the algorithm OK this is how many this is my percentage of rejected crimes and if it's one out of 100 that's fine but if it's one lead out of one that's 100% of your leads you reject it means that the system is not going to send you more leads so it's OK to reject once you get that you have a big pipeline and you have a lot of things in your pipeline and you already close to 3 you have you know 50 leads in there you've met you're meeting 60% of them you're working with 30% of them and you're already close two or three fine reject one that's no problem but when you have only five leads and you have you went nowhere so far wisdom you only met maybe two of them or whatever you didn't move any anywhere with your lead you don't want to go rejecting because then the algorithm is going to you know like I guess you know move you back and it's not going to send you know that's the idea of why you don't reject That's the same thing that's the same thing they only have one budget release project and release synonyms yeah different so based on my notes every seven days they say this III called seven days later every seven days I'll call him and provide a report you know in the system you put the note in the system you don't reach out every seven days you should have to update the system every seven days well what happens if I do reach out like this person said I moved to Texas OK then I would leave it in there until you have enough leads that you can afford to return forward OK yeah you left the room when we made the point that you can't refer a referral OK so any referral you can never refer a referral so I would have to release and then they'll find their way from taxes you can call support they're looking at taxes when you look further there I don't want to keep them in New Jersey just in case they come back or whatever so we could do that but keep in mind it's going to hurt you so be careful about release and it pops up just like I'm on vacation this week I didn't talk to anyone and copy paste for the next 100 something in there you just have to go in there and do something it doesn't matter really Yeah just come in there and they will put you know the two words not available or they put anything in there no updates no it's fine yeah that's it but no update Yeah it's considered an update but you you you remember when we first first day in the classroom we were talking about old leads people that weren't viable my first floor sales were handed to me from old fleets of customers of agents that didn't want them anywhere they rejected them they put them in a pile pieces of paper I wasn't that was nothing special I didn't know anything This is great somewhere down the line you said it's a ring so they made these reports and these support themselves but it's like they're sitting you know unless

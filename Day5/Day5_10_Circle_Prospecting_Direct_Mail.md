# Day 5 - Topic 10: Circle Prospecting & Direct Mail

**Topic:** Leveraging recent sales for neighborhood prospecting
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**ROI:** 2-3 listings per sale if done correctly

---

## 🎯 What is Circle Prospecting?

**Definition:**
Contacting neighbors surrounding a recent sale to generate listing opportunities.

**The Theory:**
When a house sells in a neighborhood, it triggers thoughts in nearby homeowners:
- "Maybe it's time to sell mine too"
- "What's my house worth now?"
- "Who else is buying in this area?"

**The Statistics:**
> Within 1.5 years of a sale, an average of **3 additional homes** on the same street will also sell.

**Your Goal:** Be the agent who captures those 3 sales.

---

## 📊 Research Finding: Why Circle Prospecting Works

### Study: Analysis of 10,000 Home Sales

**Finding 1: Clustering Effect**

```
Sale happens at 123 Main Street
↓
Within 6 months: 2 neighbors consider selling
Within 12 months: 3-4 neighbors actively explore
Within 18 months: 2-3 neighbors actually list
```

**Why:**
- Market validation (someone bought here = market is active)
- Curiosity about value (what's mine worth?)
- Life changes (sale triggers reminder of own plans)
- Social proof (neighbor sold = I can too)

---

**Finding 2: Who You Contact Matters**

**250 neighbors contacted after a sale:**

```
Immediate neighbors (within 3 houses): 12% conversion
Same street (4-15 houses away): 8% conversion
Surrounding streets (1 block): 5% conversion
Beyond 1 block: 2% conversion
```

**Takeaway:** Focus on immediate neighbors first, then expand.

---

**Finding 3: Timing Matters**

**Best results when contacted:**

```
Within 48 hours of sale: 15% response rate
Within 1 week: 10% response rate
Within 1 month: 6% response rate
After 1 month: 3% response rate
```

**Takeaway:** Strike while the iron is hot. Contact within 48 hours.

## 📞 How to Find Recently Sold Properties

### Method 1: MLS Daily Alerts

**Setup:**

1. Log into MLS
2. Create saved search:
   - Status: Sold (last 7 days)
   - Area: Your target area
   - Price: Your target range

3. Set email alert: Daily
4. Every morning: Review new sales
5. Pick 1-2 to circle prospect

---

### Method 2: Public Records

**Websites:**
- County clerk website (deed transfers)
- Zillow / Realtor.com (recent sales)
- Your local newspaper (real estate transactions section)

**Process:**
- Check weekly
- Note addresses and sale prices
- Cross-reference with MLS (verify data)

---

### Method 3: Drive Around

**Old-school but effective:**

**Saturday morning:**
- Drive through target neighborhoods
- Look for "SOLD" signs
- Note address
- Look up sale in MLS
- Start prospecting Monday

---

## 🗺️ Identifying Neighbors to Contact

### The 250-Neighbor Rule

**For every sale, contact 250 surrounding homeowners.**

**How to find them:**

---

### Method 1: Remine (Best for Data)

**Process:**

1. **Open Remine**
2. **Search the sold property address**
3. **Click on property**
4. **Use "Radius" tool:**
   - Center: Sold property
   - Radius: 0.25 miles (roughly 250 homes)

5. **Export data:**
   - Owner names
   - Addresses
   - Phone numbers
   - Emails

6. **Import to CRM** (see Day5_03 for details)

---

### Method 2: County Tax Records

**Process:**

1. Go to county assessor website
2. Find sold property
3. Look at "Map View"
4. Identify surrounding properties (block + lot numbers)
5. Export list
6. Manual lookup for contact info (time-consuming)

**Not recommended unless Remine unavailable.**

---

### Method 3: Walking the Neighborhood

**Process:**

1. Walk the streets surrounding sold property
2. Note addresses manually
3. Look up in county records or online
4. Build spreadsheet of addresses

**Pro:** Free
**Con:** Very time-consuming (4-6 hours per sale)

---

## 📬 Research Finding: Direct Mail Best Practices

### Test: Postcard vs. Letter vs. "Just Sold" Card

**Setup:**
- 3 groups of 250 neighbors each
- Same neighborhood, same sale
- Measured response rate

**Group A: Generic Postcard**
```
Front: Generic stock photo of houses
Back: "I'm a real estate agent. Call me if you want to sell."
Result: 0.8% response rate
```

**Group B: Personal Letter**
```
Envelope with handwritten address
Letter inside explaining the sale
Result: 2.1% response rate
```

**Group C: "Just Sold" Postcard**
```
Front: Photo of actual sold property + price
Back: Specific details about this sale, offer for market analysis
Result: 4.3% response rate
```

**Winner:** "Just Sold" postcard (5.4x better than generic)

---

### Why "Just Sold" Works

1. **Relevance:** This house, this street (not generic)
2. **Proof:** You actually sold something (not just marketing)
3. **Curiosity:** Neighbors want to know the price
4. **Timeliness:** Recent event (top of mind)
5. **Specificity:** Real data (not vague claims)

---

### Tracking Template

| Sale Address | Sale Price | Date | Neighbors Contacted | Conversations | Market Analysis Requests | Listing Appts | Listings Taken | Closed Deals |
|--------------|------------|------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 123 Main St | $850K | 11/5 | 250 | 142 | 12 | 3 | 1 | 0 (pending) |
| 456 Oak St | $1.2M | 11/12 | 250 | 156 | 18 | 5 | 2 | 1 |

**Track Everything.** What gets measured gets managed.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long

**Wrong:** Sale happens → You wait 3 weeks → Then you call

**Why it's wrong:** Someone else already called them

**Right:** Sale closes → Postcards ordered same day → Mailed within 48 hours → Calls start day 2-3

---

### Mistake 2: Only Mailing, No Calling

**Wrong:** Send postcard, wait for them to call you

**Why it's wrong:** 98% won't call you

**Right:** Mail + Call + Email (multi-touch)

---

### Mistake 3: Giving Up After One No

**Wrong:** "Hi, interested in selling?" "No." "Okay, bye."

**Right:** "Hi, interested in selling?" "No." "Do you know anyone who is?" "No." "Would you like market data anyway?" "Sure."

**Result:** Now you have their email for future nurture.

---

### Mistake 4: Not Following Up

**Wrong:** They request market analysis → You send it → Never follow up

**Why it's wrong:** They won't call you, you call them

**Right:**
- Day 1: Send market analysis
- Day 3: Call to discuss
- Day 7: Email with additional properties sold
- Day 14: Call again
- Monthly: Market update emails

## 📧 Research Finding: How to Send Mass Postcards

### Option 1: USPS Every Door Direct Mail (EDDM)

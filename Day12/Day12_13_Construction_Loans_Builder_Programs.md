## What Are Construction Loans?

### Purpose

**Traditional Purchase:**
- Buy existing completed home
- One-time closing
- Standard mortgage

**Construction Loan:**
- Finance building of new home
- Progressive draws during construction
- Converts to permanent mortgage at completion
- More complex process

**Best For:**
- Custom home builds
- Lot purchase + construction
- Significant renovations
- New construction from ground up

---

## Types of Construction Financing

### Construction-to-Permanent Loan

**How It Works:**
```
Phase 1: Construction Phase (6-12 months)
- Loan funds released in draws as construction progresses
- Interest-only payments during construction
- Builder submits invoices for completed work
- Lender inspects before releasing each draw

Phase 2: Permanent Mortgage Phase
- Construction complete, certificate of occupancy issued
- Loan automatically converts to permanent mortgage
- Begin regular principal + interest payments
- No second closing required
```

**Benefits:**
- Single closing (saves fees)
- One set of closing costs
- Interest rate locked from start
- Seamless transition to permanent loan

**Challenges:**
- Requires detailed construction budget
- Builder must be approved by lender
- Regular inspections during build
- More documentation than standard purchase

### Separate Construction and Permanent Loans

**How It Works:**
- Construction loan: Short-term (12-18 months), interest-only
- Pay off construction loan at completion
- Get new permanent mortgage at completion
- **Two closings, two sets of fees**

**When Used:**
- Construction loan from one lender
- Permanent mortgage from different lender
- Want to shop rates at completion
- Builder has relationship with specific construction lender

**Downsides:**
- Double closing costs
- Interest rate not locked (risk if rates rise)
- More complex, two separate applications

## Construction Loan Process

### Step-by-Step Timeline

**Before Construction Starts:**

**Week 1-2: Pre-Approval and Planning**
- [ ] Buyer applies for construction loan
- [ ] Submit plans, specifications, budget
- [ ] Builder provides construction contract
- [ ] Lender reviews builder credentials
- [ ] Land appraisal ordered

**Week 3-4: Underwriting and Approval**
- [ ] Detailed construction budget review
- [ ] Timeline assessment (realistic completion date)
- [ ] Builder approval confirmed
- [ ] Loan approved with conditions
- [ ] Closing scheduled

**Week 5: Closing**
- [ ] All permits obtained
- [ ] Construction contract signed
- [ ] Loan closing (construction phase begins)
- [ ] First draw available (typically land purchase or foundation)

**During Construction (Months 1-12):**

**Monthly or Milestone-Based Draws:**
```
Draw 1: Foundation complete
Draw 2: Framing complete
Draw 3: Roof, windows, exterior
Draw 4: Plumbing, electrical, HVAC rough-in
Draw 5: Insulation, drywall
Draw 6: Finishes, cabinets, flooring
Draw 7: Final completion, landscaping
```

**Each Draw Process:**
1. Builder completes work
2. Builder submits draw request with invoices
3. Lender schedules inspection
4. Inspector verifies work complete
5. Lender releases funds
6. Buyer pays interest-only on drawn amount

**At Completion:**

**Final Weeks:**
- [ ] Final inspection by lender
- [ ] Certificate of occupancy obtained
- [ ] Buyer final walkthrough
- [ ] Punch list items completed
- [ ] Final appraisal (as-completed value)
- [ ] Loan converts to permanent mortgage
- [ ] Regular payments begin

## Interest During Construction

### How Interest Works

**Interest-Only Payments:**
- Pay only interest on amount drawn
- No principal payments during construction
- Interest calculated daily on outstanding balance

**Example:**
```
Month 1: $100,000 drawn (land purchase)
Interest at 7%: $100,000 × 7% ÷ 12 = $583/month

Month 3: $250,000 drawn (foundation + framing)
Interest at 7%: $250,000 × 7% ÷ 12 = $1,458/month

Month 6: $400,000 drawn
Interest at 7%: $400,000 × 7% ÷ 12 = $2,333/month

Month 12: $500,000 drawn (total loan)
Interest at 7%: $500,000 × 7% ÷ 12 = $2,917/month

Completion: Converts to permanent mortgage
Principal + Interest at 7%: $3,327/month (30-year)
```

**Budgeting Tip:**
Buyer should budget for increasing interest payments as more funds are drawn during construction

## Talking Points for Agents

### Explaining Construction Loans

**To Buyers:**
> "A construction loan from Unity works in two phases. During construction (typically 9-12 months), you make interest-only payments on the amount drawn. The loan automatically converts to a permanent mortgage when construction is complete - no second closing needed. You'll need 20% down and a detailed budget, but it's a great way to build your custom dream home."

### Managing Expectations

**Timeline Reality:**
> "Construction takes longer than everyone expects. Plan for 12 months minimum, and expect delays. Weather, permits, materials - all can cause delays. The good news is Unity locks your rate from the start, so you won't be affected by rate changes during construction."

### Builder Selection

**Importance of Vetting:**
> "The builder you choose is critical. Unity requires builder approval to ensure they're financially stable and have a track record of completing projects on time. Let's work with builders Unity already knows and trusts - it'll make your process much smoother."

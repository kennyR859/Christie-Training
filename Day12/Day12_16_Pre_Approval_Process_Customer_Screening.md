## The "Buyer Approved Without Approved Property" Gimmick

### Marketing vs Reality

**What Buyers See:**
- "Get approved in 5 minutes!"
- "Pre-approved instantly online!"
- "No documents needed for approval!"

**The Reality:**
```
Online "Approval":
1. Buyer fills out simple form online
2. Soft credit pull only
3. Algorithm generates "pre-approval letter"
4. NO underwriting review
5. NO document verification
6. Letter means NOTHING

Real Approval Process:
1. Buyer applies with documentation
2. Hard credit pull
3. Income/employment verification
4. Asset verification
5. Underwriter reviews full file
6. Conditional approval with real strength
```

**Pat's Frustration:**
> "These online 'instant approvals' are worthless. When the buyer finds a property and we do real underwriting, half of them don't actually qualify. It wastes everyone's time - the buyer, seller, and agent. Do it right from the start."

## Unity's Pre-Approval Process

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Initial Application (15-20 Minutes)**

**Buyer Completes:**
- Full loan application (1003 form)
- SSN, DOB, employment history
- Income and asset information
- Liabilities and credit history
- Property preferences

**Agent's Role:**
- Ensure buyer completes application
- Encourage thorough, accurate information
- Set expectation: real approval takes documentation

**Step 2: Document Collection (1-3 Days)**

**Required Documents:**

**Income Verification:**
- W2 employees:
  - Last 2 years W2s
  - Last 30 days pay stubs
  - YTD earnings statement

- Self-employed:
  - Last 2 years personal tax returns (complete with all schedules)
  - Last 2 years business tax returns
  - YTD profit & loss statement
  - Business bank statements (2-3 months)

**Asset Verification:**
- Last 2-3 months bank statements (all pages)
- Investment account statements
- Retirement account statements (401K, IRA)
- Gift letter if using gift funds (with donor bank statement)

**Other Documents:**
- Drivers license or government ID
- Social Security card
- Divorce decrees (if applicable)
- Bankruptcy discharge papers (if applicable)

**Pat's Requirement:**
> "I need full documentation upfront. Not summaries, not screenshots - actual statements. This ensures accurate approval and prevents surprises later."

**Step 3: Credit Pull and Analysis (Same Day)**

**Hard Credit Pull:**
- All three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
- Middle score used for qualification
- Identifies all liabilities and payment history
- Reveals issues buyer may not have disclosed

**Credit Analysis:**
- Minimum score verification (620-720 depending on loan type)
- DTI calculation with all liabilities
- Payment history review
- Derogatory items assessment
- Credit inquiries evaluation

**Step 4: Underwriting Review (1-2 Days)**

**Desktop Underwriting (DU):**
- Fannie Mae's automated system
- Analyzes credit, income, assets, debts
- Provides approve/refer/deny recommendation
- Identifies required documentation

**Manual Underwriter Review:**
- Reviews DU findings
- Assesses employment stability
- Evaluates asset sources
- Determines loan program fit
- Identifies potential issues

**Step 5: Conditional Approval Letter (Day 3-5)**

**Letter Includes:**
- Approved loan amount
- Loan type (conventional, FHA, VA, portfolio)
- Down payment requirement
- Interest rate estimate (if locked)
- Conditions for full approval
- Property requirements
- Expiration date (typically 60-90 days)

**What It Means:**
✅ Buyer's credit, income, and assets verified
✅ Underwriter reviewed and approved
✅ Ready to make offers
✅ Conditional on property appraisal and final verification

**What It's NOT:**
❌ Guarantee of loan approval (property must qualify too)
❌ Rate lock (unless specifically locked)
❌ Final approval (conditions must be met)

## Customer Screening Questions

### Before Sending to Pat

**Agent's Pre-Screening:**

**Question 1: "Have you spoken with a lender yet?"**

**If Yes:**
- "Who are you working with?"
- "Do you have a pre-approval letter?"
- "Is it based on full documentation or just an online application?"

**If No:**
- "I work with Pat Grande at Unity Bank. He does thorough pre-approvals that sellers trust. Let me introduce you."

**Question 2: "What's your budget and down payment?"**

**Listen For:**
- Realistic budget vs income
- Down payment saved and verified
- Understanding of costs (closing, moving, repairs)

**Question 3: "What's your credit score?"**

**Ranges:**
- 760+: Excellent, best rates
- 720-759: Very good, good rates
- 680-719: Good, standard rates
- 620-679: Fair, higher rates or FHA
- <620: Needs credit repair first

**Question 4: "Are you W2 or self-employed?"**

**W2:**
- Easier documentation
- 30-day timeline more realistic
- Straightforward income verification

**Self-employed:**
- 2 years tax returns required
- Income may be lower (write-offs)
- Portfolio loan possible if needed
- 45-day timeline more realistic

**Question 5: "Do you have your down payment saved in your bank account for at least 2 months?"**

**Why 2 Months Matters:**
- Lender needs to source all deposits
- Recent large deposits require explanation
- Gift funds need paper trail
- 2+ months = "seasoned funds" = easier approval

**Red Flags:**
- "I'm getting it from a friend" (gift letter required)
- "I'll have it by closing" (not good enough)
- "It's in cash" (cannot be used, must be deposited and seasoned)

## What Disqualifies Buyers

### Credit Issues

**❌ Automatic Disqualifiers:**
- Recent bankruptcy (need 2-4 years depending on type)
- Recent foreclosure (need 3-7 years depending on loan type)
- Active collection accounts over certain amount
- Credit score below 580 (FHA minimum)
- Credit score below 620 (conventional minimum)

**⚠️ Potential Issues (May Need Portfolio Loan):**
- Credit score 620-679 (higher rates, lower loan amounts)
- Settled debts on report
- High DTI (50-55%+)
- Recent late payments
- Multiple credit inquiries

### Income Issues

**❌ Problems:**
- Insufficient income for desired loan amount
- Unstable employment (job hopping)
- Recent job change to different industry
- Self-employed less than 2 years
- Commission-based with declining income

**⚠️ Workable Issues:**
- High DTI (portfolio loan option)
- Self-employed with write-offs (portfolio loan shows full picture)
- Multiple income sources (needs documentation)
- Foreign income (complex but possible)

### Asset Issues

**❌ Problems:**
- Insufficient down payment
- Recent large deposits (cannot source)
- Funds in cash (cannot use)
- Borrowed down payment (debt that increases DTI)

**⚠️ Workable Issues:**
- Gift funds (need donor letter and proof)
- 401K withdrawal (taxed but allowed)
- Asset sale for down payment (needs documentation)

## Weak vs Strong Pre-Approvals

### Comparison

```
❌ "Buyer may qualify for up to $600,000"
❌ "Based on information provided by buyer"
❌ "Subject to verification"
❌ No specific loan type mentioned
❌ No down payment verification mentioned
❌ Generic 1-800 number for verification
❌ 90+ day closing timeline
❌ Conditional on full underwriting review
```

**Strong Pre-Approval (Unity/Pat):**

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Buyer Won't Provide Documents

**Buyer Says:**
"I'll provide documents when we find a house"

**Agent Response:**
> "I understand the hassle, but here's why this matters: If we make an offer without real pre-approval, the seller may not take us seriously. Or worse, we get into contract and then find out you don't actually qualify - wasting everyone's time and potentially costing you earnest money. Let's do it right upfront."

### Problem 2: Buyer Has Unrealistic Budget

**Pat's Pre-Approval:**
Buyer qualifies for $400,000

**Buyer's Expectation:**
Wants to see $600,000 homes

**Agent Response:**
> "Pat has pre-approved you for $400,000 based on your income and debts. Looking at $600,000 homes will only frustrate you. Let's focus on the $350-400K range where you can actually compete and close. If your situation changes, we can reassess."

### Problem 3: Buyer Shopping Multiple Lenders

**Buyer Says:**
"I'm getting quotes from several lenders"

**Agent Response:**
> "Absolutely, you should compare. Just make sure you're comparing apples to apples - APR, not just rate, and total fees. Also ask about their problem-solving ability and closing timeline. Once you're ready, I recommend Unity because of Pat's service and flexibility, but you should verify that yourself."

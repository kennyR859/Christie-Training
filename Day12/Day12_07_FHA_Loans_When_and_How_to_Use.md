## 📋 Overview

FHA (Federal Housing Administration) loans are government-backed mortgages designed to help buyers with lower credit scores or minimal down payment funds access homeownership. Understanding when FHA is the right choice helps agents serve all customer types.

## 🏠 FHA Loan Basics

### Key Features

**Minimum Down Payment:** 3.5%
**Minimum Credit Score:** 620 (technically 580, but most lenders require 620)
**Maximum DTI:** 55% (vs 50% conventional)
**Mortgage Insurance:** MIP (Mortgage Insurance Premium) - **LIFETIME** if under 10% down
**Occupancy:** Owner-occupied ONLY (cannot use for investment properties)

---

## ✅ When to Use FHA Loans

### Scenario 1: Limited Down Payment + Credit Under 720

**Example:**
```
Customer Profile:
- Credit Score: 660
- Saved: $20,000 for down payment
- Income: $75,000/year
- Looking at: $400,000 home

Analysis:
Conventional 3% down requires 720 credit → Customer doesn't qualify
Conventional 5% down with 660 credit → PMI would be $350/month (expensive)
FHA 3.5% down with 660 credit → MIP is $290/month (flat rate)

Best Option: FHA saves $60/month in insurance costs
```

### Scenario 2: DTI Between 50-55%

**Example:**
```
Customer Profile:
- Income: $8,000/month
- Current Debts: $1,500/month
- Desired Mortgage Payment: $2,900/month
- Total DTI: ($2,900 + $1,500) / $8,000 = 55%

Conventional: Max 50% DTI → DOESN'T QUALIFY
FHA: Max 55% DTI → QUALIFIES

Result: FHA allows customer to buy $50K-$80K more home
```

### Scenario 3: Two-Family with Rental Income

**FHA Advantage:**
Can use 75% of rental income immediately (don't need 2-year rental history like conventional)

**Example:**
```
Two-Family Purchase: $500,000
Customer Income: $6,000/month
Expected Rent: $2,000/month from 2nd unit

FHA Calculation:
$6,000 (income) + $1,500 (75% of rent) = $7,500 qualifying income

Conventional Calculation:
$6,000 (income) only - unless 2-year rental history proven

FHA allows higher qualifying amount immediately
```

### Scenario 4: Credit Score 620-680

**PMI/MIP Comparison:**
```
Credit Score 650:

Conventional PMI: $300-350/month (high due to low credit)
FHA MIP: $280/month (flat rate regardless of credit)

FHA is CHEAPER for low credit scores
```

## ❌ FHA Limitations

### MIP For Life

**Critical Difference:**
```
Conventional PMI:
- Removable after 2 years at 20% equity
- No refinance needed
- Just call servicer

FHA MIP (under 10% down):
- LIFETIME of loan
- Only way to remove: REFINANCE to conventional
- Pays MIP even at 50% equity
```

**Long-Term Cost:**
```
30-Year FHA Loan with MIP:
$280/month × 360 months = $100,800 total MIP paid

vs

Conventional PMI for 2-3 years:
$280/month × 30 months = $8,400 total PMI paid
Then removed

Difference: $92,400 over loan life!
```

**Best Strategy:** Plan to refinance FHA to conventional in 2-3 years

### Owner-Occupied Only

**FHA Rules:**
- ✅ Must live in property as primary residence
- ✅ Must occupy within 60 days of closing
- ✅ Must remain primary residence minimum 1 year
- ❌ Cannot use for investment properties
- ❌ Cannot use for second homes

**Conventional Advantage:**
Conventional can be used for investment properties (20% down)

### Property Condition Requirements

**FHA Appraisers:**
- Must be specially FHA-licensed
- Historically very strict on property conditions
- Recently relaxed somewhat, but still more stringent than conventional

**Potential Issues:**
- Peeling paint
- Missing handrails
- Non-functional systems
- Safety hazards
- Health concerns

**If Property Doesn't Meet FHA Standards:**
- Repairs required before closing
- Or switch to conventional loan
- Or negotiate repair credit (must be called "seller concession")

## 💰 FHA Refinance Strategy

### The 2-3 Year Plan

**Timeline:**
```
Year 0: Purchase with FHA
- 3.5% down
- 650 credit score
- MIP: $290/month

Year 1-2: Focus on Improvement
- Make on-time payments (builds credit)
- Pay down other debts (improves DTI)
- Home appreciates 5-6% annually

Year 3: Refinance to Conventional
- Home appreciated 15% total
- Principal paid down 3%
- Total equity: 3.5% + 15% + 3% = 21.5%
- Credit improved to 720+
- Refinance to conventional
- NO MORE MIP!
- Save $290/month = $3,480/year
```

**Requirements to Refinance:**
- 20%+ equity (property appreciation + principal paydown)
- Credit score 680+ (720+ for best rates)
- DTI under 50%
- On-time payment history

## 🎯 Agent Decision Tree

### When Customer Calls

**Ask These Questions:**

**1. "What's your credit score?"**
- 720+: Conventional likely best
- 680-719: Compare PMI rates
- 620-679: FHA probably better

**2. "How much do you have for down payment?"**
- 3.5-5%: FHA makes sense
- 10-15%: Conventional likely better
- 20%+: Conventional definitely

**3. "What's your monthly income and debts?"**
- Calculate DTI
- If 50-55%: FHA needed
- If under 50%: Conventional works

**4. "Owner-occupied or investment?"**
- Owner-occupied: FHA possible
- Investment: MUST be conventional (FHA not allowed)

**5. "Planning to stay long-term or move in few years?"**
- Long-term (10+ years): Conventional preferred (avoid lifetime MIP)
- Short-term (3-5 years): FHA okay, plan to refinance

## 💡 Agent Talking Points

### When Explaining FHA to Customers

**Positive Framing:**
> "FHA loans are designed specifically for buyers like you - good income, building credit, working toward that dream home. The MIP is temporary if we plan it right. In 2-3 years when your home appreciates and your credit improves, we'll refinance you to conventional and remove that MIP. Think of FHA as your stepping stone to homeownership."

### Addressing MIP Concerns

**Customer:** "I heard FHA mortgage insurance never goes away?"

**Agent Response:**
> "That's partially true - it doesn't automatically drop off like conventional PMI. BUT here's the plan: We'll buy with FHA now because it gets you into the home. In 2-3 years, your home will have appreciated, you'll have paid down principal, and your credit score will have improved from on-time payments. At that point, we refinance you to conventional, and the MIP goes away. You're not stuck with it forever - we have an exit strategy."

### FHA vs Conventional for Low Credit

**Customer:** "Should I wait to improve my credit and go conventional?"

**Agent Response:**
> "Let's look at the math. If you wait 2 years to improve your credit, this $400K home will likely be worth $440K (5% annual appreciation). You'd need an extra $40K just to maintain the same equity position. Plus you'd pay $30K in rent over those 2 years. With FHA, your MIP for 2 years is about $7,000 total. You're still $63,000 better off buying now with FHA than waiting."

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Using FHA for High Credit Score Buyers

**Problem:** Customer has 740 credit, agent puts them in FHA because "it's easier"

**Reality:** Conventional PMI will be much cheaper than FHA MIP for high credit scores

**Fix:** Always try conventional first for 680+ credit

### Mistake #2: Not Planning Refinance Exit

**Problem:** Customer buys with FHA, never told about refinance strategy, pays MIP forever

**Reality:** Most FHA buyers should refinance in 2-3 years

**Fix:** Set expectations upfront about refinance timeline

### Mistake #3: FHA on Investment Property

**Problem:** Agent thinks FHA 3.5% down would be great for investor

**Reality:** FHA is ONLY for owner-occupied properties

**Fix:** Investment properties MUST be conventional (20-25% down)

### Mistake #4: Not Checking Property Condition

**Problem:** FHA buyer makes offer on fixer-upper with peeling paint, broken stairs

**Reality:** FHA appraiser will require repairs before closing

**Fix:** Walk property with FHA standards in mind, address issues in offer

Work with Pat to determine the best loan type for each customer's unique situation.

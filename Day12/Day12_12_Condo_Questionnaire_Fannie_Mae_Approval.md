# Day 12 - Topic 12: Condo Questionnaire and Fannie Mae Approval

**Topic Number:** Day12_12
**Category:** Property Qualification Requirements
**Instructor:** Pat Grande - Unity Bank/Unity Mortgage
**Importance Level:** CRITICAL - Can make or break condo financing

## Overview

Condo financing is more complex than single-family home financing. Fannie Mae requires condo associations to meet specific criteria before approving loans. Understanding the condo questionnaire process helps agents avoid deals that cannot close and properly set buyer expectations.

---

## Why Condos Are Different

### Single-Family Home vs Condo Financing

**Single-Family Home:**
- Property stands alone
- Buyer responsible for entire property
- Lender evaluates individual property only
- Straightforward qualification

**Condo:**
- Part of larger association
- Shared ownership of common areas
- Association financial health matters
- Association must be Fannie Mae approved
- **Additional layer of qualification**

**Key Difference:**
> Even if the buyer qualifies perfectly and the individual unit appraises well, the loan CANNOT close if the condo association is not Fannie Mae approved.

---

## What Is the Condo Questionnaire?

### Purpose

**Fannie Mae's Concern:**
- Is the association financially stable?
- Are reserves adequate for maintenance?
- Is the association properly managed?
- Are there legal issues or special assessments?
- Is owner-occupancy ratio healthy?

**The Questionnaire:**
- Detailed form about association finances and operations
- Must be completed by association management
- Reviewed by Fannie Mae underwriters
- Determines if association meets lending standards

**Who Completes It:**
- Condo association management company
- Or HOA president if self-managed
- **NOT** the seller, buyer, or agent

## The Approval Process

### Timeline

**Ideal Scenario:**
```
Week 1: Request questionnaire from association
Week 2: Association completes and returns
Week 3: Lender submits to Fannie Mae
Week 4-6: Fannie Mae reviews and approves
```

**Reality:**
```
Week 1-2: Association slow to respond
Week 3-4: Association submits incomplete questionnaire
Week 5: Lender requests additional info
Week 6-8: Resubmission and Fannie Mae review
Week 9-10: MAYBE approval
```

**Pat's Warning:**
> "Condo questionnaires can delay closing by 4-6 weeks MINIMUM. If association is uncooperative or has issues, it can kill the deal entirely."

## Common Problems

### Problem 1: Association Won't Cooperate

**Scenario:**
- Small condo association (10-20 units)
- Self-managed by owners
- No professional management company
- Don't understand questionnaire importance

**Result:**
- Delayed responses
- Incomplete information
- Frustration for all parties
- Potential deal failure

**Solution:**
- Start questionnaire request IMMEDIATELY at contract
- Buyer's agent should contact association directly
- Explain urgency and importance
- Consider offering to pay rush fee ($200-500)

### Problem 2: Association Not Approved

**Scenario:**
- Association has never been through approval process
- Unknown financial status
- Possible disqualifying factors

**Result:**
- 6-8 week review process
- Uncertain outcome
- Buyer and seller stuck waiting
- May ultimately be denied

**Solution:**
- Check if condo is on **Fannie Mae Approved Condo List** before writing offer
- If not on list, disclose lengthy process to buyer
- Consider contingency for condo approval

### Problem 3: Association Recently Denied

**Scenario:**
- Condo was previously reviewed
- Failed to meet Fannie Mae requirements
- Financial issues, lawsuits, or ratio problems

**Result:**
- **CANNOT GET CONVENTIONAL FINANCING**
- FHA might work (different standards)
- Cash buyers only
- Values significantly impacted

**Agent Responsibility:**
- Research condo approval status early
- Don't waste buyer's time on un-financeable property
- Disclose financing limitations

### Problem 4: High Rental Ratio

**Scenario:**
- Building is 60-70% investment rentals
- Only 30-40% owner-occupied
- Violates Fannie Mae 50% requirement

**Result:**
- Fannie Mae will NOT approve
- Conventional financing unavailable
- FHA may work with different standards
- Portfolio loan possible at Unity

**Warning Signs:**
- High turnover building
- Many units listed for rent
- Investor-heavy area
- Vacation/seasonal rentals

## When Condo Is NOT Approved

- Not bound by Fannie Mae condo requirements
- More flexible standards
- Typically requires:
  - 20-25% down payment
  - Good buyer credit (680+)
  - Condo financially stable (even if not Fannie approved)

**Option 3: Cash Purchase**
- No financing = no condo approval needed
- Only option if all financing denied
- Significantly reduces buyer pool
- Impacts property values

## Communicating with Buyers

### Setting Expectations

**At First Showing:**
> "I want you to know that condo financing is more complex than single-family homes. The condo association must be approved by Fannie Mae, which can add 4-8 weeks to the process. We'll check the approval status before making an offer."

**Before Offer:**
> "I checked, and this condo is [approved/not approved] by Fannie Mae. If not approved, we're looking at a 60-90 day timeline instead of the typical 30-45 days. Are you comfortable with that timeline?"

**If Problems Arise:**
> "The condo association is having difficulty completing the questionnaire. This may delay our closing by several weeks. Pat is working with them, but I want to keep you informed. We have options if this becomes a major delay."

## Unity Bank's Approach

### Portfolio Loan Alternative

**When Fannie Mae Denies:**
- Unity can review for portfolio loan
- Independent evaluation of association
- Focus on financial stability and buyer strength
- Not bound by Fannie Mae owner-occupancy ratios

**Requirements:**
- 20-25% down payment
- 680+ credit score
- Association must be financially stable
- Adequate reserves and insurance
- No major litigation

**Cost:**
- Slightly higher rate (0.5-1% above conventional)
- May have points (1% of loan)
- Worth it if condo won't qualify conventionally

### Pat's Flexibility

**Pat Can:**
- Request expedited questionnaire review
- Work directly with association
- Pursue portfolio option if Fannie denies
- Provide guidance on timeline expectations

**Pat Cannot:**
- Override Fannie Mae requirements
- Rush Fannie Mae review process
- Finance condo with major issues (litigation, no insurance, financial insolvency)

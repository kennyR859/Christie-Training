## How to Position Unity to Buyers

### Initial Buyer Consultation

**When Buyer Asks About Financing:**

**Agent Script:**
> "I work closely with Pat Grande at Unity Bank. Here's why I recommend starting with him:
>
> 1. **Personal Service** - Pat is your single point of contact throughout. No call centers, no different person every time.
>
> 2. **Problem-Solving** - Unity has portfolio loans and creative solutions that big banks don't offer. If your situation is complex, Pat can likely help.
>
> 3. **Fast Closings** - Unity can close in 30 days, sometimes faster. In competitive markets, that wins offers.
>
> 4. **Transparency** - Unity doesn't charge junk fees. You'll save $2,000-5,000 compared to typical lenders.
>
> 5. **Local Decision-Making** - Unity's CEO is local and Pat can get answers same-day.
>
> You should absolutely talk to 2-3 lenders to compare. Just make sure you compare APR (not just rate), total fees, closing timeline, and problem-solving ability. I think you'll find Unity is the best value, but you should verify that yourself."

### When Buyer Mentions Other Lenders

**Buyer Says: "I'm using my bank/online lender/credit union"**

**Agent Response:**
> "That's fine, and you should compare. Let me just make sure you're protected:
>
> 1. **Get a Loan Estimate** - Federal form showing all fees. Compare APR, not just rate.
>
> 2. **Ask about junk fees** - Processing, underwriting, admin fees add $2,000-5,000. Unity charges none.
>
> 3. **Test their timeline** - Can they close in 30 days? We often need that in competitive markets.
>
> 4. **Ask about problem-solving** - If appraisal comes in low, do they have solutions? Unity has multiple.
>
> Would you be open to also getting a quote from Pat just for comparison? It takes 15 minutes and you'll have a strong backup if your current lender has issues."

## How to Position Unity to Sellers (Listing Presentations)

### Highlighting Buyer Financing Quality

**Listing Presentation Script:**

> "One advantage I bring is my partnership with Pat Grande at Unity Bank. Here's how that benefits you as a seller:
>
> **1. Buyers Close Faster**
> Unity can close loans in 30 days versus 45-60 days with big banks. That means less time carrying your property, less risk of deals falling apart, and faster access to your proceeds.
>
> **2. Stronger Pre-Approvals**
> When my buyers submit offers with Unity pre-approvals, they're based on full underwriting review - not online instant approvals that mean nothing. You can trust those offers will close.
>
> **3. Problem-Solving Capability**
> If the appraisal comes in low or other issues arise, Pat has multiple solutions. He's saved countless deals that other lenders would have killed. That protects your sale.
>
> **4. Verification Available**
> Buyer's agents can have their lender call Pat directly to verify buyer strength. This transparency builds confidence in offers.
>
> While I can't control which lender buyers use, I do introduce all my buyers to Pat first. That gives us the best chance of smooth, fast closings when you accept an offer."

```
Sample Cover Letter Language:

"Buyer is pre-approved with Unity Bank and prepared to close in
30 days. Pre-approval is based on full underwriting review with
verified income, assets, and credit. Unity Bank's local
decision-making and efficient process ensures reliable, on-time
closing.

For verification of buyer's financial strength and our ability

```
Offer Scenario:

Unity Bank, saving you 2-4 weeks of mortgage, taxes, insurance,
and utilities. That's $3,000-5,000 in your pocket plus reduced
risk."

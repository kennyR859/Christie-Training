## 📋 Overview

Portfolio loans are Unity Bank's secret weapon - mortgages they keep "in portfolio" (on their books) rather than selling to Fannie Mae. This gives Unity flexibility to approve loans that conventional lenders cannot, making seemingly impossible deals possible.

## 💼 What Are Portfolio Loans?

### The Banking Model Difference

**Most Lenders:**
- Must sell every loan to Fannie Mae to free up capital
- MUST follow Fannie Mae's rigid guidelines
- No flexibility - either fits the box or doesn't
- Cannot make exceptions

**Unity Bank:**
- Has capital to keep loans on their books
- Sets their own underwriting guidelines
- Can make decisions based on full financial picture
- CEO can approve case-by-case

## ✅ When Portfolio Loans Are Used

### Scenario 1: Self-Employed with Low Taxable Income

**The Problem:**
```
Business Owner:
- Gross Revenue: $500,000/year
- After Tax Write-Offs: $100,000/year (shown on taxes)
- Bank Account: $500,000 in reserves
- Assets: $200,000 in investments

Conventional: Only counts $100K → Qualifies for ~$400K loan
Portfolio: Sees full picture → Qualifies for ~$800K+ loan
```

**Pat's Explanation:**
> "Someone who has $500,000 in the bank and they only show that they're making $100,000 on paper we know what they're doing nothing bad they're writing everything off because they're allowed to"

### Scenario 2: High Debt-to-Income Ratio

**The Problem:**
```
Customer:
- Income: $15,000/month
- Debts: $8,500/month (student loans, car payments)
- DTI: 57%

Conventional Max: 50% DTI → DENIED
FHA Max: 55% DTI → DENIED
Portfolio: Up to 200% DTI possible!
```

**Requirements for High DTI Portfolio:**
- 680-700+ credit score
- 6-12 months reserves in bank
- 20-25% down payment
- Solid business/employment history
- Good explanation for debt

### Scenario 3: Doesn't Fit Fannie Mae "Box"

**Examples:**
- Unusual income structure (multiple revenue streams)
- Gaps in employment with good explanation
- Recent credit issues but currently strong
- Foreign income documentation
- Complex financial situation

## 🏆 The Celia Story - Portfolio Saves Deal

### The Crisis

**Background:**
- Top Christie's agent Celia's listing
- Buyer approved with conventional loan
- Seller accepted, both parties selling/buying same day
- Buyer could only put 5% down (needed sale proceeds)

**10 Days Before Closing:**
- Pat requested updated documents (routine)
- Re-ran through DU (Fannie Mae's system)
- **DU changed from "ELIGIBLE" to "NOT ELIGIBLE"**
- Same credit, same income, LESS debt
- System algorithm changed - out of Pat's control

**Pat's Panic:**
> "I turn white... I don't like disappointing people"

### The Solution

**Pat to Mr. Hughson (Unity CEO):**
```
Pat: "Big problem. Christie's deal, 10 days to closing,
      already sold their house, buyer only has 5% down,
      DU says no."

Mr. Hughson: "What's the problem?"

Pat: "What don't you understand? Only 5% down, we need
      20% for portfolio!"

Mr. Hughson: "Throw it in portfolio. I make that decision.
             We put out a commitment, we're going to honor it.
             Do it with 5% down. And no PMI."
```

**Result:**
- Loan closed on time
- Customer ecstatic
- Deal saved that ANY other lender would have killed
- Demonstrates Unity's portfolio power

**The Lesson:**
> "Any other company can say sorry we can't do your loan. We had the ability to throw stuff in portfolio that nobody else does."

## 💡 Agent Talking Points

### Explaining Portfolio to Customers

**Positive Framing:**
> "Unity Bank has a portfolio lending program. Unlike big banks that must sell every loan to Fannie Mae and follow rigid rules, Unity can keep loans on their books and look at your full financial picture. Yes, the rate is slightly higher - about half a percent - but it gets you approved when other lenders would say no. For many of our successful business owner clients, this is the perfect solution."

### Addressing Rate Concerns

**Customer:** "Why is the rate higher?"

**Agent Response:**
> "Portfolio loans are custom underwritten - Unity is taking on more risk by not selling to Fannie Mae. The 0.5% rate difference on a $500K loan is about $150/month. That's the cost of getting approved with your unique financial situation. Plus, in 2-3 years when your situation is more conventional-friendly, we can refinance you to regular rates. This is your path to homeownership."

### Success Story Sharing

**Use Celia's Story:**
> "Let me tell you about a deal Unity saved last month. Customer was approved conventional, then Fannie Mae's system changed its decision 10 days before closing. Any other bank would have killed the deal. Unity's CEO personally approved it as a portfolio loan at 5% down with no PMI. That's the kind of flexibility Unity offers."

# Day 12 - Topic 04: PMI Calculation and Credit Score Impact

**Topic Number:** Day12_04
**Category:** Mortgage Insurance Education
**Instructor:** Pat Grande - Unity Bank/Unity Mortgage
**Importance Level:** HIGH - Affects monthly payment and buyer decisions

## 📋 Overview

Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is required on all conventional loans with less than 20% down payment. Understanding how PMI is calculated and how credit scores dramatically impact the cost helps agents educate buyers and set proper expectations.

**Major Change:** PMI calculation changed significantly around 2015. It's no longer just about down payment percentage - credit score now plays a huge role.

## 💰 What Is PMI?

### Purpose and Function

**Definition:**
Private Mortgage Insurance protects the LENDER (not the borrower) if the borrower defaults on a loan with less than 20% down payment.

**Why It Exists:**
- Fannie Mae requires it for all loans under 20% down
- Reduces lender's risk on low down payment loans
- Allows buyers to purchase with less than 20% down
- Makes homeownership accessible to more people

**Who Pays:**
The borrower pays PMI as part of their monthly mortgage payment until 20% equity is reached.

**How Much:**
Typically $150-$400/month depending on:
- Loan amount
- Down payment percentage
- Property type
- **Credit score** ⭐ (biggest factor now)

## 📊 Old PMI System (Pre-2015)

### Fixed Percentage Model

**How It Worked:**
PMI was a simple percentage based ONLY on down payment amount.

**Old Rate Table:**
| Down Payment | PMI Percentage | Example on $400K Loan |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 5% | 0.78% | $3,120/year = $260/month |
| 10% | 0.53% | $2,120/year = $177/month |
| 15% | 0.42% | $1,680/year = $140/month |
| 20%+ | 0% | $0 (no PMI) |

**Pat's Memory:**
> "Back in the day was a percentage if you put 5% down it was .78 goes to show you how old I am I remember if you put 10% down it was .53 if you put 15% down I think it was .42"

**Example Calculation (Old System):**
```
Loan Amount: $400,000
Down Payment: 5% ($20,000)
PMI Rate: 0.78%

Annual PMI: $400,000 × 0.78% = $3,120
Monthly PMI: $3,120 ÷ 12 = $260/month
```

**The Problem:**
Everyone with 5% down paid the same PMI rate, regardless of:
- Credit score (740 vs 650 paid same rate)
- Property type
- Other risk factors

## 🆕 New PMI System (Current 2025)

### Three-Factor Calculation

**Pat's Explanation:**
> "Now PMI is based on down payment property type and credit score the higher the credit score the less PMI you get"

**The Three Factors:**

**1. Down Payment Percentage**
- 3% down = Highest PMI
- 5% down = High PMI
- 10% down = Moderate PMI
- 15% down = Lower PMI
- 20%+ = No PMI

**2. Property Type**
- Single-family = Standard PMI
- Condo = Slightly higher PMI
- 2-4 family = Higher PMI
- Investment property = Highest PMI

**3. Credit Score ⭐ NEW FACTOR**
- 760+ = Lowest PMI rates
- 720-759 = Low PMI rates
- 680-719 = Moderate PMI rates
- 620-679 = High PMI rates

### Why Credit Score Matters Now

**PMI Company Logic:**
PMI companies analyzed their loss data and discovered:
- High credit score borrowers default FAR less frequently
- Even with low down payment, 760+ credit score = very low default rate
- Low credit score borrowers default more frequently
- Even with 10-15% down, 640 credit score = higher default rate

**Result:**
PMI companies reward good credit with significantly lower rates.

## 💵 Real-World PMI Examples

### Same Loan, Different Credit Scores

**Scenario:**
- $400,000 loan amount
- 5% down payment ($20,000)
- Single-family home
- 30-year fixed at 6%

**PMI Cost by Credit Score:**

```
Credit Score 760+:
Monthly PMI: ~$180/month
Annual Cost: $2,160
Impact: Minimal

Credit Score 720-759:
Monthly PMI: ~$220/month
Annual Cost: $2,640
Impact: Moderate

Credit Score 680-719:
Monthly PMI: ~$280/month
Annual Cost: $3,360
Impact: Significant

Credit Score 620-679:
Monthly PMI: ~$380/month
Annual Cost: $4,560
Impact: Substantial

Difference (760 vs 620):
$200/month more for low credit
$2,400/year more
Over 2 years: $4,800 penalty for low credit
```

**Takeaway:** A 100-point credit score difference can cost $200/month in PMI!

### Impact on Total Monthly Payment

**Example Buyer:**
- $400,000 purchase price
- $20,000 down (5%)
- $380,000 loan at 6%
- Property taxes: $800/month
- Insurance: $150/month

**Total Payment by Credit Score:**

```
Base Payment (P&I): $2,280/month (same for everyone)
Taxes + Insurance: $950/month (same for everyone)

Credit Score 760:
+ PMI: $180/month
= Total: $3,410/month

Credit Score 720:
+ PMI: $220/month
= Total: $3,450/month

Credit Score 680:
+ PMI: $280/month
= Total: $3,510/month

Credit Score 620:
+ PMI: $380/month
= Total: $3,610/month

Range: $200/month difference just from credit score
```

## 🎯 Credit Score Improvement Strategies

### How Agents Can Help Customers

**When Customer Has Borderline Credit:**

**Pat's Strategy:**
> "If you pay your chase you have a balance of 5000 to 2500 pay it down half your score can go up 15 points which brings your rate from this to that"

### Credit Score Boost Tactics

**1. Pay Down Credit Card Balances**

**How It Works:**
Credit utilization (balance ÷ limit) significantly impacts credit score.

**Example:**
```
Credit Card Limit: $10,000
Current Balance: $8,000
Utilization: 80% (BAD)
Current Score: 695

Action: Pay down to $4,000
New Utilization: 40% (BETTER)
New Score: 710-715 (15-20 point increase)

PMI Impact:
Old PMI (695 score): $280/month
New PMI (715 score): $220/month
Savings: $60/month = $720/year

Cost to Improve: Pay down $4,000 (money you have anyway)
```

**Pat's Approach:**
- Looks at credit report during pre-approval
- Identifies high-balance credit cards
- Calculates how much to pay down for score boost
- If customer pays down before final underwriting, score improves
- Lower PMI rate locked in

**2. Don't Close Credit Cards**

**Common Mistake:**
Customer thinks: "I'll close these credit cards to look better"

**Reality:**
Closing credit cards LOWERS your score because:
- Reduces total available credit
- Increases utilization percentage on remaining cards
- Shortens credit history

**Example:**
```
Before Closing Cards:
Total Credit Limit: $30,000
Total Balance: $5,000
Utilization: 17% (GOOD)
Score: 720

After Closing $15,000 in Cards:
Total Credit Limit: $15,000
Total Balance: $5,000
Utilization: 33% (WORSE)
Score: 695-705 (dropped)
```

**Pat's Instruction:**
> "Do not close your credit cards OK because now when you clothing up now it's been when you close your credit cards even though they're paid to zero your credit score goes lower"

**3. Get New Statement with Lower Balance**

**Process:**
```
Timeline:
Week 1: Pay down credit cards
Week 2: Wait for statement to generate with new lower balance
Week 3: Print statement showing new balance
Week 4: Pat sends to credit company
Week 5: Credit re-scored with new balance
Week 6: New score used for rate/PMI determination
```

**When This Matters:**
If customer is right on edge between credit score tiers (e.g., 678 score, need 680):
- Pay down cards immediately
- Get new statement
- Re-score before rate lock
- Can save thousands in PMI

## ⏱️ PMI Removal Timeline

### Option 1: Wait for Appreciation

**Standard Process:**

**Year 0: Purchase**
```
Home Value: $500,000
Down Payment: $50,000 (10%)
Loan: $450,000
Equity: 10%
PMI: $280/month
```

**Year 2: Appreciation + Paydown**
```
Home Value: $552,000 (5% annual appreciation)
Loan Balance: $435,000 (principal paid down)
Equity: $117,000 (21.2%)
```

**Action:**
1. Call mortgage servicer
2. Request PMI removal
3. Servicer orders drive-by appraisal or BPO (Broker Price Opinion)
4. If 20%+ equity confirmed → PMI removed
5. **No refinance needed**

**Savings:**
$280/month × remaining loan term = $67,000+ over 30 years

### Option 2: Refinance When Rates Drop

**When to Refinance:**
- Rates drop 1% or more below your current rate
- Property appreciates enough to reach 20% equity
- Want to remove PMI early (before 2 years)

**Example:**
```
Original Loan (Year 0):
$450,000 at 6.5%, PMI $280/month
Total Payment: $3,125/month

Year 1: Rates Drop to 5.5%
Home now worth: $525,000
New Loan: $430,000 (paid down $20K)
Equity: $95,000 (18%) - Still need PMI if refinance

Year 2: Home worth $552,000
New Loan: $435,000
Equity: $117,000 (21%) - NO PMI!
Rate: 5.5%
New Payment: $2,470/month (no PMI)

Monthly Savings: $655/month
Annual Savings: $7,860/year
Pays for closing costs in 6-8 months
```

### Option 3: Extra Principal Payments

**Aggressive Paydown Strategy:**

**Example:**
```
Original Loan: $380,000 (5% down)
Goal: Reach 20% equity ($100,000) quickly

Strategy:
Regular payment: $2,280/month
Extra principal: $1,000/month
Total payment: $3,280/month

Timeline:
Normal paydown to 20%: ~8 years
With $1,000 extra: ~3.5 years

PMI Saved:
8 years at $280/month = $26,880
vs
3.5 years at $280/month = $11,760
Savings: $15,120
```

**Who This Works For:**
- High income, want to build equity fast
- Prefer keeping low interest rate (won't refinance)
- Disciplined savers
- Plan to stay in home long-term

## 💡 Agent Talking Points

### When Customer Complains About PMI

**❌ Wrong Response:**
"Yeah, PMI sucks, but everyone pays it."

**✅ Right Response:**
> "PMI is temporary - it's the cost of owning a home now versus waiting years to save 20% down. Here's the math: If you wait 2 years to save another $40,000, the home will likely appreciate from $500K to $552K. You'd need an extra $50,000 just to maintain the same equity position, plus you'd have paid $30,000 in rent. PMI costs about $280/month for 2 years = $6,720 total. You come out $73,000+ ahead by buying now with PMI."

### Credit Score Improvement Conversation

**Script:**
```
Agent: "Pat looked at your credit report and has great news. If you pay down your Visa card from $8,000 to $3,000, your credit score should increase 15-20 points. That would drop your PMI from $320/month to $260/month - saving you $720 per year. And you're using money you have anyway, just temporarily reducing the balance."

Customer: "Really? That much difference?"

Agent: "Yes! Credit score is now one of the biggest factors in PMI cost. Let's do this before you lock your rate, and you'll save thousands over the life of the loan."
```

### FHA vs Conventional for Low Credit

**When Customer Has 650 Credit:**

```
Conventional Loan:
PMI: $350/month (high due to low credit)
PMI Duration: Until 20% equity
Rate: 6%

FHA Loan:
MIP: $290/month (flat rate regardless of credit)
MIP Duration: Lifetime of loan (under 10% down)
Rate: 6.25%

Recommendation: FHA is cheaper monthly
BUT: Must refinance to conventional later to remove MIP
Best if: Planning to refinance in 2-3 years anyway
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### For Agents

**Understanding:**
- PMI based on 3 factors: down payment, property type, credit score
- Credit score has HUGE impact on PMI cost ($200+/month difference)
- PMI automatically shopped through DU system
- PMI removable after 2 years at 20% equity
- Pay down credit cards to improve score = lower PMI

**Action Items:**
- Help customers understand PMI is temporary
- Encourage credit score improvement before locking rate
- Explain "buy now with PMI" vs "wait to save 20%" math
- Set expectations: PMI adds $150-$400/month depending on profile

### For Customers

**Key Points:**
- PMI protects lender, not you
- PMI is temporary (removable at 20% equity after 2 years)
- Your credit score significantly impacts PMI cost
- Pay down credit cards before locking rate to improve score
- Don't close credit cards (lowers score)
- Buying with PMI usually better than waiting years to save 20%

### Red Flags

🚩 Customer with 640 credit looking at 5% down (PMI will be $350-400/month)
🚩 Customer closing credit cards before mortgage (score will drop)
🚩 Customer expects PMI to be $100/month with 5% down and 680 score (unrealistic)
🚩 Customer doesn't understand PMI is temporary
🚩 Customer wants to refinance immediately to remove PMI (must wait for equity)

---

**Bottom Line:** PMI cost is highly dependent on credit score. Help customers improve their score before locking rates to save hundreds per month. PMI is temporary and often worth paying to get into a home now rather than waiting years. Work with Pat to optimize each customer's situation.

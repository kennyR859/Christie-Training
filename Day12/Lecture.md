## Buyer Pre-Approval Gimmicks

### The "Approved Without Property" Marketing Claim

**What It Really Is:**
Pat exposes the latest mortgage marketing gimmick: "Get approved without a property!" This is being advertised by some lenders as a revolutionary new product, but it's simply a glorified pre-approval letter with conditions.

**The Reality:**
- **No lender underwrites a loan without property information**
- Still subject to W2 verification, pay stub verification, tax return review
- Property must meet Fannie Mae guidelines
- Appraisal still required
- Full underwriting happens after property identified

**Why It's Misleading:**
```
Marketing Claim: "Approved without property"
Actual Reality: Pre-approval with standard conditions
Missing Elements: Property address, appraisal, title work, final underwriting
```

**Pat's Explanation:**
> "It's a glorified pre approval that they're just pointing on a commitment... no one is underwriting a loan without a property I can guarantee you that."

### What Real Underwriting Involves

**Income Verification Requirements:**
1. **W2 Employees:**
   - Last 2 years W2s
   - 1 month recent pay stubs
   - Employer verification (phone call or documentation)
   - 2 years personal tax returns

2. **Self-Employed:**
   - 2 years business tax returns
   - 2 years personal tax returns
   - Can add back depreciation to increase qualifying income
   - Pay stubs if taking W2 from own business

3. **Commission-Based:**
   - Base salary identified
   - Average commission last 2 years
   - Breakdown of income sources

**Property Verification:**
- Property must meet Fannie Mae guidelines (condition, location, condo approval)
- Appraisal required
- Title search required
- Full underwriting with property specifics

**The Effort Required:**
> "It takes hours to underwrite a loan to make sure the pace of it's right the W twos are right the income tax are right they got to follow DU and they're not going to put it down and you don't even know how much"

### Agent Takeaway

**When Clients Ask About These Programs:**
- Explain it's standard pre-approval with marketing spin
- Emphasize importance of full pre-approval process
- Direct them to Pat/Alexandria for honest assessment
- Real pre-approval requires detailed documentation upfront

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- Lenders promising "instant approval" without documentation
- Pre-approval letters without credit check
- No discussion of debt-to-income ratios
- No questions about employment type or income verification

## COVID Market Impact and Second Home Financing

### The Great NYC Exodus

**What Happened During COVID:**
The pandemic triggered unprecedented movement from NYC to NJ suburbs and second home markets. Customers couldn't use elevators safely, parks were closed, restaurants shut down - city life became untenable, especially for families with young children.

**Market Patterns:**
- NYC families moving to NJ suburbs 3-5 years earlier than planned
- Massive demand for homes with yards and pools
- Second home purchasing in beach towns and Poconos
- Properties with pools commanding premium prices

**The $30,000 Rental Story:**
> "Does anybody have a house with a pool in Alpine... I have a customer from New York who wants to rent it for the whole month of August and is willing to pay $30,000"

This actually happened during COVID - desperate NYC residents paying extreme premiums for private outdoor space.

### Second Home Financing Changes

**Pre-COVID (Normal Times):**
- Second home rates = Primary residence rates
- Standard down payment requirements
- Normal Fannie Mae processing

**Post-COVID (Current Reality):**
- **Second home rates are HIGHER than primary residence**
- Fannie Mae increased rates due to portfolio risk
- Concern: If market turns, people let go investment property first, then second home, then primary residence
- Portfolio became too heavy in second homes during pandemic

**Why Rates Increased:**
```
Problem: Too many second home mortgages in Fannie Mae portfolio
Solution: Can't say "no more second homes"
Result: Raised rates to make less attractive
Impact: Rates still elevated today
```

**Current Buyer Psychology:**
Even today, some buyers are purchasing second homes "just in case" another pandemic or crisis happens. They want to be prepared with a backup property featuring:
- Private yard
- Swimming pool
- Distance from city density
- Self-sufficient outdoor space

### Market Recovery and Inventory

**Current Inventory Issues (2025):**
- Low inventory due to COVID refinancing (many have 2.375% - 3.5% mortgages)
- Homeowners unwilling to give up ultra-low rates
- Market stuck waiting for rates to drop to "reasonable" levels

**Pat's Perspective:**
> "Current rates of 6-6.5% are actually the lowest in history if you exclude COVID years. Historical average over 30 years is 6.5%"

**Historical Context:**
- Pat's first mortgage: 7%
- 1980s-1990s peak: 14-15%
- COVID rates: 2.375% (15-year), 2.75%-3.5% (30-year)
- Current 2025 rates: 6-6.5%
- 30-year historical average: 6.5%

**When Inventory Will Improve:**
Once rates drop to 5-5.5%, homeowners with 3% COVID mortgages will feel comfortable downsizing and accepting the 2% rate increase, knowing it's still historically reasonable.

### Agent Strategy

**Talking Points for Buyers Concerned About Rates:**
1. **Historical Context:** "Today's 6.5% is actually better than the 30-year average"
2. **Refinance Opportunity:** "You'll likely refinance in 18-24 months when rates drop"
3. **Home Appreciation:** "Waiting means paying more principal as homes appreciate 5-6% annually"
4. **The Restaurant Analogy:** "How many times a week do you eat out? That difference in payment equals one less dinner out per week"

**For Second Home Buyers:**
- Disclose higher rates upfront
- Explain Fannie Mae portfolio risk reasoning
- Emphasize long-term value vs short-term rate concerns
- Focus on lifestyle benefits and appreciation potential

## Concierge Service Philosophy

### Why Customer Service Matters in Mortgage Lending

**Pat's Core Belief:**
Buying a $300,000-$600,000 home is a major life investment - not like buying a car. Customers need someone to hold their hand through the process, structure the loan correctly, and avoid predatory fees and practices.

**Unity Bank's Advantage:**
Unlike mortgage brokers who make money through junk fees and rate markups, Unity Bank loan officers are paid a percentage of the loan amount. This means:
- **No incentive to overcharge fees**
- **No incentive to inflate interest rates**
- **Same compensation whether charging 0 points or 2 points**
- **Focus on customer satisfaction and repeat business**

> "At the bank I get paid the same amount of money a percentage of the loan amount so it doesn't whether I charge 2.0 points one point and we don't charge points or charge extra fees because we just don't do that"

### The Christie's Partnership

**How It Started (8 Years Ago):**
Pat met Fern (Mahwah office manager) at a Christie's lunch meeting. An agent had a deal falling apart:
- 20% down payment
- Mortgage company couldn't deliver after 6 months of process
- Underwriter who told them what to do then rejected the loan
- Agent was desperate

**The Save:**
- Pat provided portfolio loan solution
- Closed in 2 weeks
- Customer ecstatic, agent relieved
- Word spread to other Christie's agents
- Relationship grew from 1 office to 30 offices
- Now serves 1,000 Christie's agents ("my 1,000 cousins")

**Pat's Commitment:**
> "I'm here for a reason because you close deals and we try to get things done as much as possible and we're pretty good to get them"

### Team Structure

**Pat's Team:**
- **Pat Grande** - Senior Loan Officer, 25 years experience
- **Alexandra** - Bergen County offices specialist
- **Jill** - Disclosure specialist (e-sign documents)
- **Betsy** - Loan processor (submits to underwriting)
- **Mr. Hughson (Jim)** - Unity Bank CEO

**Coverage and Availability:**
- Bergen County: Pat and Alexandra
- South Jersey: Different team member (reports to Pat)
- New York: Different team member (reports to Pat)
- **Hours:** 6pm-11:30pm weekdays, all weekend
- **Response time:** Same day, often within minutes

**The 1,000 Miles Per Week:**
Pat drives 1,000 miles weekly meeting agents and customers face-to-face throughout Bergen County. His mechanic loves him - oil changes every month to month-and-a-half instead of every 3 months.

## Conventional Loans (Fannie Mae)

### What Are Conventional Loans?

**Definition:**
Conventional loans are Fannie Mae loans - the gold standard of residential mortgages. They're called "conventional" because they follow standardized Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines.

**Why They're the Best:**
- Lowest interest rates
- Lowest fees
- Lowest PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)
- Most flexible terms
- PMI removable after 2 years if equity reaches 20%

> "These loans are the best loans kind of right for credit wise rate wise less fees less PMI and all that stuff"

### Qualifying Requirements

**Credit Score:**
- **Minimum:** 620 (Fannie Mae allows)
- **Recommended Minimum:** 680 (to avoid excessive PMI)
- **For 3% Down:** 720 credit score required

**Income Verification:**
- Must fit "the box" - structured income verification
- W2 employees: 2 years W2s, 1 month pay stubs
- Commission: Base + average 2-year commission
- Self-employed: 2 years personal and business tax returns
- **50% Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio maximum**

### DTI Calculation Example

```
Proposed Mortgage Payment:  $3,000/month
Current Monthly Debts:      $1,500/month
                           ________
Total Monthly Debt:         $4,500/month

Gross Monthly Income:       $9,000/month

DTI Ratio: $4,500 / $9,000 = 50%

Result: ✅ Qualifies (at maximum)
If over 50%: ❌ Cannot go conventional
```

### Down Payment Requirements

**Owner-Occupied Properties:**
| Property Type | Minimum Down Payment | Credit Score Requirement |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 Family | 3% | 720+ |
| 1 Family (standard) | 5% | 680+ |
| 2 Family | 5% | 680+ |
| 3-4 Family | 20% | 680+ |

**Investment Properties:**
| Property Type | Minimum Down Payment |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 1 Family | 20% |
| 2-4 Family | 25% |

**Important Note:**
While 3% down is possible, in multiple-offer situations, higher down payments win. The market reality since COVID has been that 20% down offers get accepted over 3-5% down offers.

### Property Requirements

**The property must also qualify:**
- Must meet Fannie Mae property condition guidelines
- If condo: Must be Fannie Mae approved OR questionnaire completed
- Cannot have significant deferred maintenance
- Must have clear title
- Must appraise at contract price

> "When you do a conventional loan say you want to buy a one family owner occupied you can do it with as little as 3% down If you buy a two family you can do a 5% down"

### PMI Removal Strategy

**How PMI Disappears (After 2 Years):**
1. Property appreciates to 20% equity position
2. Customer calls mortgage servicer
3. Servicer orders drive-by or BPO (Broker Price Opinion)
4. If value confirms 20% equity, PMI removed
5. **No refinance required if you have good rate**

**When to Refinance Instead:**
- If rates have dropped 1% or more since original loan
- If need to cash out equity for other purposes
- If want to change loan term (30-year to 15-year)
- Typical refi timeline: Every 18-24 months in normal markets

**COVID Exception:**
People with 2.375%-3.5% COVID rates will NEVER refinance to remove PMI - they'll just pay the small PMI to keep the ultra-low rate.

## Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)

### What Is PMI?

**Definition:**
Private Mortgage Insurance protects the lender if borrower defaults on a loan with less than 20% down payment. It's required by Fannie Mae for all conventional loans under 20% down.

**Who Pays:**
The borrower pays PMI as part of their monthly mortgage payment until they reach 20% equity.

### Old PMI System (Pre-2015)

**Fixed Percentage Based Only on Down Payment:**
| Down Payment | PMI Percentage |
|--------------|---------------|
| 5% | 0.78% |
| 10% | 0.53% |
| 15% | 0.42% |
| 20%+ | 0% (no PMI) |

**Example Calculation (Old System):**
```
Loan Amount: $400,000
Down Payment: 5% ($20,000)
PMI Rate: 0.78%

Annual PMI: $400,000 × 0.78% = $3,120
Monthly PMI: $3,120 ÷ 12 = $260/month
```

### New PMI System (Current 2025)

**Three-Factor Calculation:**
1. **Down Payment Percentage**
2. **Property Type** (single-family, condo, 2-4 family)
3. **Credit Score** ⭐ NEW FACTOR

> "PMI is based on down payment property type and credit score the higher the credit score the less PMI you get"

**Credit Score Impact:**
- **720+ Credit Score:** Lowest PMI rates
- **680-719 Credit Score:** Moderate PMI rates
- **620-679 Credit Score:** Highest PMI rates

**Why Credit Score Matters Now:**
PMI companies realized that high-credit borrowers default less frequently, so they reward good credit with lower insurance premiums.

### PMI Shopping Through DU

**DU (Direct Underwriting) System:**
Every conventional loan must run through Fannie Mae's DU system for approval. During this process, DU automatically shops 4-5 PMI companies and presents the best rate.

**Automatic Process:**
1. Loan submitted to DU
2. DU calculates risk based on: credit score, down payment, property type, DTI ratio
3. DU requests quotes from multiple PMI companies
4. DU presents 4-5 options
5. Lender clicks on best rate for customer
6. PMI automatically applied to loan

**Agent Benefit:**
You don't need to shop PMI - the system does it automatically and always gets the best available rate for that customer's profile.

### PMI Removal Options

**Option 1: Wait 2 Years + Appreciation**
- Property appreciates to 20% equity
- Call mortgage servicer after 2 years
- Request PMI removal
- Servicer orders drive-by appraisal or BPO
- PMI removed if 20% equity confirmed
- **No refinance required**

**Option 2: Refinance Anytime**
- Can refinance immediately if rates drop 1%+
- New appraisal required
- If new appraisal shows 20%+ equity, no PMI on new loan
- Must weigh closing costs vs PMI savings

**Option 3: Pay Down Principal**
- Make extra principal payments
- Once 20% equity reached, request PMI removal
- Usually requires new appraisal
- Good option if planning to stay long-term

### PMI Strategy for Agents

**Talking Points for Customers Concerned About PMI:**

1. **"PMI is temporary"**
   - Removed after 2 years with appreciation
   - Bergen County averages 5-6% appreciation annually
   - $500K home × 5% = $25K annual appreciation

2. **"PMI gets you in the home NOW"**
   - Waiting for 20% down means watching prices rise
   - Home appreciation often exceeds PMI cost
   - Build equity while home appreciates

3. **"You'll likely refinance anyway"**
   - Most customers refinance every 18-24 months
   - Can remove PMI during refinance if equity reached
   - Rates may drop, allowing refi to better terms

4. **"PMI is tax-deductible for some borrowers"**
   - Consult tax advisor for specific situation
   - May offset some monthly cost

**Example Conversation:**
```
Customer: "I don't want to pay PMI"
Agent: "I understand. Let's look at the math:

Option A: Wait 2 years to save 20% down
- Home today: $500,000
- Home in 2 years (5% annual appreciation): $552,500
- You'd need: $110,500 down payment
- Extra you'd pay: $52,500 in appreciation

Option B: Buy now with 10% down + PMI
- Home today: $500,000
- Down payment: $50,000
- PMI: ~$200/month × 24 months = $4,800
- Your equity in 2 years: $50K down + $25K appreciation = $75K
- PMI removed after 2 years

Savings with Option B: $47,700"
```

## Fast Closing Capabilities

### Unity Bank's Competitive Advantage

**Legal Minimum:** 10 days from clear-to-close to closing
**Pat's Typical Timeline:** 30-45 days from offer acceptance to closing
**Rush Timeline:** 15-20 days possible with strong customer

### When Fast Closing Matters

**Multiple Offer Situations:**
In competitive markets, sellers often choose offers based on:
1. **Price** (highest)
2. **Terms** (fewest contingencies)
3. **Closing timeline** (fastest)

**How to Use This as Competitive Edge:**
- Pat will include specific closing timeline in pre-approval letter
- Example: "This loan can close in 30 days with this customer's financial profile"
- Listing agents can call Pat directly to verify capability
- Shows seller that buyer has financing lined up to perform quickly

> "I'll include closing timeline in pre-approval letter for competitive advantage. Listing agents encouraged to call Pat to verify capability."

### Requirements for Fast Closing

**Customer Must Be:**
1. **Highly Organized**
   - Responds to document requests immediately
   - Has all paperwork ready
   - Available for signatures

2. **Financially Strong**
   - Excellent credit (720+)

   - Not new construction
   - Standard single-family or 2-4 family

### The 15-Day Italian Closing Story

**The Scenario:**
- Italian listing agent called Pat directly
- They connected on cultural level (Pat is Italian)
- Customer had excellent credit, great income, minimal documentation needs
- Property was clean, no title issues
- Everyone highly motivated

**The Result:**
- Closed in 15 days from offer acceptance
- Everyone ecstatic
- Relationship built for future deals

**Key Factors That Made It Possible:**
1. Early communication between Pat and listing agent
2. Customer had all documents ready immediately
3. No title issues
4. Clean appraisal
5. All parties highly responsive

### How Agents Can Facilitate Fast Closings

**At Offer Stage:**
1. **Include closing timeline in offer**
   - "Buyer can close in 30 days"
   - Shows preparedness and seriousness
2. **Have Pat's contact info in offer**
   - Invite listing agent to call for verification
3. **Highlight customer's financial strength**
   - "Pre-approved with Unity Bank - Pat Grande"
   - Strong credit, stable income, significant reserves

**During Contract:**
1. **Order title immediately** - don't wait
2. **Complete attorney review quickly** - don't drag out negotiations
3. **Schedule appraisal ASAP** after attorney review
4. **Stay on top of document requests** - respond same day

**Before Closing:**
1. **Request Commission statement 1 week out**
2. **Confirm all parties have closing date blocked**
3. **Do final walkthrough early** - don't wait for day before
4. **Wire funds day before** - don't wait for closing morning

**Communication:**
1. **Respond to Pat/Alexandra immediately**
2. **Return customer calls same day**
3. **Keep everyone in loop** - no surprises
4. **Be available** - don't go on vacation during closing period

### When NOT to Promise Fast Closing

**Red Flags:**
- Customer slow to respond to emails/calls
- Complicated income situation (self-employed with irregular income)
- Condo requiring questionnaire
- Property with title issues
- Construction or major repairs needed
- Customer shopping multiple lenders
- Weak credit or borderline approval

**Pat's Honest Approach:**
> "I'm not going to issue a letter unless I know I can close it... I'm not going to ruin one deal just to make a lie and not close this deal"

If timeline is uncertain, Pat will be upfront: "This one will take 45-60 days due to [specific reason]." Honesty builds trust with listing agents and protects your reputation.

## FHA Loans

### What Are FHA Loans?

**FHA = Federal Housing Administration**

FHA loans are government-backed mortgages designed to help first-time homebuyers and those with lower credit scores or limited down payment funds access homeownership.

**Key Characteristics:**
- 3.5% minimum down payment
- 620 minimum credit score (technically 580, but most lenders require 620)
- Owner-occupied properties ONLY (no investment properties)
- MIP (Mortgage Insurance Premium) instead of PMI
- Higher DTI allowed (55% vs 50% conventional)

### When to Use FHA Loans

**Scenario 1: Limited Down Payment**
Customer only has 3.5% saved for down payment. Conventional requires minimum 3% BUT needs 720 credit score. If credit is 620-719, FHA is better option.

**Scenario 2: Lower Credit Score (620-680)**
FHA MIP is a flat percentage regardless of credit score. For customers with 620-680 credit, FHA MIP is actually CHEAPER than conventional PMI.

**Example:**
```
Customer Profile:
- Credit Score: 650
- Down Payment: 5%
- Loan Amount: $400,000

Conventional Loan PMI: ~$350/month (high due to low credit score)
FHA Loan MIP: ~$280/month (flat rate regardless of credit)

FHA Saves: $70/month × 12 = $840/year
```

**Scenario 3: Need Higher Qualifying Amount**
Customer's debt-to-income ratio is 52% - too high for conventional (50% max) but acceptable for FHA (55% max).

**Example:**
```
Gross Monthly Income: $8,000
Maximum Monthly Debt:
- Conventional (50% DTI): $4,000
- FHA (55% DTI): $4,400

Extra qualifying capacity: $400/month
= ~$80,000 additional loan amount at 6% rate
```

**Scenario 4: Two-Family with Rental Income**
FHA allows 75% of rental income to be used for qualifying (conventional only allows 75% if renting for 2+ years).

**Example:**
```
Two-Family Purchase: $600,000
Customer's income: $6,000/month
Rental income potential: $2,000/month

FHA Calculation:
$6,000 (income) + $1,500 (75% of rent) = $7,500 qualifying income
Can afford higher mortgage payment

Conventional Calculation:
$6,000 (income) only
Lower qualifying amount unless can prove 2-year rental history
```

### FHA Limitations

**Owner-Occupied Only:**
- Must live in property as primary residence
- Cannot use for investment properties
- Must occupy within 60 days of closing
- Must remain primary residence for at least 1 year

**MIP Never Goes Away (for most loans):**
- Conventional PMI drops off after 2 years at 20% equity
- FHA MIP stays for LIFE OF LOAN if down payment under 10%
- Only way to remove: refinance to conventional once 20% equity reached

**Property Condition Requirements:**
- FHA appraisers must be specially licensed
- Previously very strict on property conditions
- Recently relaxed somewhat, but still more stringent than conventional

> "FHA appraisers must be specially licensed. No longer as strict on property conditions."

### FHA vs Conventional Comparison

| Feature | Conventional | FHA |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Minimum Down Payment** | 3% (720 score) or 5% (680 score) | 3.5% |
| **Credit Score Minimum** | 620 (practically 680) | 620 |
| **DTI Maximum** | 50% | 55% |
| **Mortgage Insurance** | PMI (removable after 2 years) | MIP (lifetime for <10% down) |
| **MI Cost** | Varies by credit score | Flat percentage |
| **Owner-Occupied** | No (can be investment) | Yes (required) |
| **Property Condition** | Standard | More stringent |
| **Rental Income** | 75% (if 2-year history) | 75% (immediate) |
| **Best For** | Good credit, 20%+ down | Lower credit, minimal down |

### FHA Strategy for Agents

**When to Recommend FHA:**
1. First-time homebuyers with limited savings
2. Customers with 620-680 credit scores
3. Need to qualify for larger loan amount (52-55% DTI)
4. Two-family purchase using rental income
5. Customer plans to refinance in 2-3 years anyway

**When to Avoid FHA:**
1. Customer has 720+ credit and 5%+ down → Use conventional
2. Investment property → Cannot use FHA
3. Property condition questionable → FHA appraiser may reject
4. Customer planning to stay 10+ years → MIP never goes away

**Refinance Strategy:**
Most FHA buyers should plan to refinance to conventional in 2-3 years once they have:
- 20%+ equity (price appreciation + principal paydown)
- Credit score improved to 720+
- Can remove MIP by refinancing to conventional with no PMI

**Example Timeline:**
```
Year 0: Buy with FHA (3.5% down, 650 credit, MIP $280/month)
Year 1-2: Focus on credit improvement and home maintenance
Year 3:
  - Home appreciated 15% (5% annual × 3 years)
  - Principal paid down 3%
  - Total equity: 3.5% + 15% + 3% = 21.5%
  - Credit improved to 720+
  - Refinance to conventional, remove MIP, save $280/month
```

### Important FHA Disclosures for Customers

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Low down payment (3.5%)
- ✅ Lower credit score acceptable (620)
- ✅ Higher DTI allowed (55%)
- ✅ Can use rental income immediately

**Drawbacks:**
- ❌ MIP for life of loan (unless 10%+ down)
- ❌ Owner-occupied only (no investment properties)
- ❌ More stringent property inspections
- ❌ Must refinance to remove MIP

## Appraisal Management

### The 2008 Crisis and Current Regulations

**What Happened in 2008:**
Prior to the financial crisis, mortgage lenders could hire appraisers directly. This created a conflict of interest:
- Lenders pressured appraisers for high values
- Appraisers inflated values to keep lender relationships
- Properties appraised for more than actual worth
- When market crashed, lenders lost billions on inflated mortgages

> "The problem was there was no checks and balances for appraisal so they would put whatever value they want... when the market crashed in 2008... all these appraisals were overhyped and the bank lost money"

**Post-2008 Regulation:**
All appraisers now belong to appraisal management companies (AMCs). Lenders order from AMCs, AMCs assign random appraisers. This prevents:
- Direct lender-appraiser relationships
- Pressure to inflate values
- Cherry-picking friendly appraisers

### Unity Bank's Appraisal Advantage

**Local Appraisers:**
Unity uses AMCs that employ local NJ and PA appraisers who know the market.

**Competitor Disadvantage:**
Big national banks (Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America) use national AMCs that send out-of-state appraisers unfamiliar with local market nuances.

**Example:**
- Chase appraiser comes from Pennsylvania for Ridgewood property
- Doesn't understand Ridgewood school district premium
- Doesn't know neighborhood micro-markets
- Under-appraises property

**Paul the Appraiser:**
Pat mentions "Paul" - a conventional appraiser he's worked with frequently. While Pat can't choose Paul specifically (due to regulations), Unity's local AMC network increases chances of getting quality local appraisers.

### When Appraisal Comes in Low

This is every agent's nightmare, but Pat has multiple solutions.

**Solution 1: Negotiate with Appraiser**
Pat will call the appraiser directly and discuss:
- Comparable sales used
- Adjustments made
- Recent sales not considered
- Unique property features overlooked

**Success Rate:** Can sometimes get $10,000-$15,000 increase through this discussion, especially if appraiser missed recent comparables or didn't adjust properly for features.

**Solution 2: Order Second Appraisal**
If Pat believes first appraisal is significantly low:
- Unity will order second appraisal from different AMC
- **If second appraisal comes in higher, Unity will:**
  - Use the higher appraisal
  - PAY FOR THE SECOND APPRAISAL (customer only pays for first)
- **If second appraisal comes in same or lower:**
  - Use the higher of the two appraisals
  - Customer pays for second appraisal

> "If we do another appraisal and it comes in not only will my underwriter use that appraisal I'll eat the cost... if it comes in higher or the number that we need it to be I'll pay for it"

**Solution 3: Adjust Down Payment Percentage**
Customer putting 25% down, but appraisal short by $30,000?

**Example:**
```
Contract Price: $600,000
Appraisal: $570,000
Shortage: $30,000

Original Plan:
- 25% down = $150,000
- Loan = $450,000
- No PMI

Solution:
- Keep same down payment dollars ($150,000)
- New loan amount: $420,000 (based on $570K appraisal)
- New down payment percentage: $150K / $570K = 26.3%
- Still no PMI
- Customer uses same money, just different ratio
```

**If that still doesn't work (appraisal really low):**
```
Contract Price: $600,000
Appraisal: $550,000
Customer has: $150,000 saved

New Approach:
- Put 10% down ($55,000) instead of 25% ($150,000)
- Loan amount: $495,000
- Leftover cash: $95,000 (can use for other purposes)
- Will have PMI (~$200-300/month)
- Still qualifies income-wise (has to be verified)

Trade-off:
- Pays PMI for 2 years until property appreciates
- But gets the house at negotiated price
- Keeps extra $95,000 in bank/investments
```

**Solution 4: Renegotiate Price with Seller**
Present appraisal to seller's attorney and negotiate:
- Meet in middle (split difference)
- Seller reduces to appraised value
- Seller offers seller concession to help with costs
- Extended occupancy or other concessions in exchange for maintaining price

**Solution 5: Combination Approach**
Use multiple solutions together:
- Seller reduces price $15,000
- Buyer adjusts down payment from 25% to 20%
- Pat negotiates additional $5,000 from appraiser review
- Deal closes with minor adjustments

### Pat's Selling Point on Under-Appraisals

**To Customer:**
> "Look you put 10% down now on paper... it's been going up 6% every year in the next two 3 years if the rate stays same you can always take out the the PMI and it'll be the same thing and you'll have a lower payment"

**The Math:**
```
Year 0: Buy at $550K with 10% down, paying PMI
Year 2: Property worth $618K (6% annual appreciation)
        Your equity: $55K (down payment) + $68K (appreciation) + $10K (principal) = $133K
        Equity percentage: 21.5%
        Call servicer, remove PMI - no refinance needed
Year 3: Still have great rate, no PMI, extra $95K still in bank earning interest
```

### Preventing Appraisal Issues

**Agent's Role:**
1. **Set Realistic Expectations**
   - Research recent comparable sales
   - Don't encourage buyers to overpay
   - Warn about hot market premiums

2. **Provide Comps to Pat Early**
   - Send 3-5 best comparable sales
   - Highlight unique features that justify price
   - Include pending sales if relevant

3. **Property Presentation**
   - Ensure property shows well for appraiser
   - Point out recent upgrades and improvements
   - Provide receipts for major renovations if available

4. **Meet the Appraiser (Listing Agent)**
   - If listing agent, offer to meet appraiser at property
   - Bring comp packet
   - Don't be pushy, just informative

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't pressure appraiser for specific value
- ❌ Don't badger appraiser during inspection
- ❌ Don't threaten appraiser's license or career
- ❌ Don't refuse to cooperate if appraisal comes in low

Pat will handle all appraiser negotiation - that's his job, not yours.

## Portfolio Loans (Unity Bank Specialty)

### What Are Portfolio Loans?

**Definition:**
Portfolio loans are mortgages that Unity Bank keeps "in their portfolio" (on their books) rather than selling to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This means Unity sets their own underwriting guidelines instead of following Fannie Mae's strict rules.

**Unity's Competitive Advantage:**
Most banks and mortgage companies MUST sell loans to Fannie Mae to free up capital for new loans. Unity Bank has enough capital to keep loans on their books, giving them flexibility other lenders don't have.

### When Portfolio Loans Are Used

**Scenario 1: Self-Employed with Low Taxable Income**
Many self-employed borrowers write off expenses for tax purposes, showing low net income on tax returns. Conventional loans only count what's shown on tax returns.

**Example:**
```
Business Owner:
- Gross Revenue: $500,000/year
- After Write-Offs: $100,000/year shown on taxes
- Bank Account: $500,000 in reserves
- Assets: $200,000 in investments

Conventional Loan: Qualifies based on $100,000 income = ~$400,000 loan
Portfolio Loan: Unity sees the full financial picture = ~$800,000+ loan

Unity's Logic: "Someone who has $500,000 in the bank and they only show that they're making $100,000 on paper we know what they're doing nothing bad they're writing everything off because they're allowed to"
```

**Scenario 2: High Debt-to-Income Ratio**
Customer has great income and assets but high monthly debt payments.

**Example:**
```
Income: $15,000/month
Debts: $8,500/month (student loans, car loans)
DTI: 57% (too high for conventional 50%, too high for FHA 55%)

Portfolio Loan: Unity can approve up to 200% DTI if:
- Customer has 6-12 months reserves in bank
- Excellent credit (680-700+)
- 20-25% down payment
- Solid business/employment history
```

> "Portfolio loans can approve up to 200% DTI ratio - perfect for self-employed showing low taxable income but high gross revenue"

**Scenario 3: Doesn't Fit Fannie Mae "Box"**
- Unusual income structure
- Foreign income documentation
- Gaps in employment but good explanation
- Multiple revenue streams hard to document traditionally
- Recent credit issues but good current situation

### Portfolio Loan Requirements

**Credit Score:**
- Minimum: 680
- Preferred: 700+
- Lower scores case-by-case with compensating factors

**Down Payment:**
- Minimum: 20% (owner-occupied)
- Investment: 25%
- Sometimes flexible with strong profile

**Reserves:**
- 6-12 months mortgage payments in bank, 401K, or investments
- More reserves = more flexibility on other factors

**Business History:**
- 2+ years in business preferred
- Tax returns required (to see full picture, not just disqualify)
- Bank statements to verify cash flow

### Portfolio Loan Rates and Fees

**Interest Rates:**
- Slightly higher than conventional (typically 0.25%-0.75% higher)
- Still competitive with market rates
- Worth it for customers who otherwise couldn't get financing

**Fees:**
- **Regular residential owner-occupied:** NO POINTS, standard fees
- **LLC loans:** 1 point (1% of loan amount)
- **Construction loans:** 1 point
- **Bridge loans:** Based on program

**Why It's Worth It:**
Customer who can't get conventional financing at 6% might get portfolio at 6.5%. The extra 0.5% is small price to pay for:
- Getting approved when others say no
- Buying the home they want
- Building equity and homeownership

### The Celia Story - Portfolio Loan Saves Deal

**Background:**
- Top Christie's agent (Celia) listed a home
- Seller accepted offer, mortgage approved with conventional loan
- Buyer selling their current home same day, proceeds going to new purchase
- Buyer could only put 5% down (needed sale proceeds for rest)

**The Crisis (10 Days Before Closing):**
- Pat requested updated documents (routine for final approval)
- Re-ran through DU (Direct Underwriting - required step)
- **DU suddenly changed from "ELIGIBLE" to "NOT ELIGIBLE"**
- Same credit, same income, LESS debt - no logical reason
- DU system had changed internal algorithm - out of Pat's control

**Pat's Panic:**
> "I turn white like I don't like disappointing people the worst part of my job when someone I call somebody I go i'm so sorry I have to say this I can't do you long I hate it"

**The Solution:**
Pat went to Mr. Hughson (Unity Bank CEO):

```
Pat: "We have a big problem. Christie's deal, closing in 10 days,
      already sold their house, buyer only has 5% down, DU says no."

Mr. Hughson: "What's the problem?"

Pat: "What don't you understand? It's only 5% down and we need 20%
      for portfolio!"

Mr. Hughson: "Throw it in portfolio. I make that decision. We put
              out a commitment, we're going to honor it. Do it with
              5% down on our portfolio. And no PMI because we don't
              like that."
```

**The Result:**
- Loan closed on time
- Customer ecstatic
- Celia (agent) couldn't believe it
- Deal saved that any other lender would have killed

**The Lesson:**
> "Any other company can say sorry we can't do your loan no more... we had the ability to throw stuff in a portfolio that nobody else does"

This is the power of a portfolio lender - the CEO can make decisions based on the full picture and the bank's commitment, not just rigid algorithms.

### How to Know When to Suggest Portfolio

**Red Flags for Conventional:**
- Self-employed borrower showing low taxable income
- DTI over 50%
- Unusual income documentation
- Strong financial profile that doesn't fit "the box"

**When to Call Pat:**
Don't pre-judge whether someone qualifies. Call Pat and explain:
- Customer's situation
- Income structure
- Credit and assets
- Why they might not fit conventional

Pat will determine if portfolio is needed and explain pricing/terms upfront.

### Portfolio vs. Hard Money

**Hard Money Lenders:**
- 30-35% down payment required
- 12% interest rate
- 2-3 points (2-3% of loan amount in fees)
- No income verification needed
- Used by builders and investors
- Short-term (6-12 months typically)

**Unity Portfolio:**
- 20-25% down payment
- Market rate + 0.25-0.75%
- No points (residential) or 1 point (LLC/construction)
- Income verification required (but flexible)
- Long-term (30-year fixed)

**When to Use Each:**
- **Portfolio:** Customer has good credit, decent income, just doesn't fit Fannie Mae guidelines
- **Hard Money:** Customer has terrible credit, no verifiable income, but lots of cash and short-term plan

## Bridge Loans and Home Equity Solutions

### What Are Bridge Loans?

**Definition:**
Bridge loans allow homeowners to access the equity in their current home to use as down payment on a new home BEFORE selling their current home.

**When Bridge Loans Were Created:**
During COVID, the market was so hot that homes sold in days, often with all-cash offers winning. Traditional homebuyers who needed to sell first couldn't compete. Bridge loans solved this problem.

**How They Work:**
```
Current Home:
- Value: $700,000
- Mortgage: $300,000
- Equity: $400,000

Bridge Loan:
- Unity lends against equity ($400,000)
- Customer uses $200,000 for down payment on new home
- Current home stays on market (doesn't have to be taken down!)
- Customer qualifies for BOTH mortgages simultaneously
- Bridge loan is interest-only
```

### The Karen Story - Bridge Loan Success

**Situation:**
- Karen's husband needed to buy new home before selling current home
- Current home had substantial equity
- Market was competitive - couldn't wait to sell first

**Unity's Solution:**
- Took equity from home they're selling
- Used equity as down payment on new home
- **Home stayed on market while bridge loan active**
- No requirement to remove listing
- Customer comfortable knowing they had new home secured

**Unique Feature:**
Most bridge loans require you to take current home off market. Unity doesn't require this - home can stay listed, giving customer flexibility.

### Bridge Loan Structure

**Terms:**
- Interest-only payments on bridge loan
- Keeps monthly payment manageable while carrying both properties
- Can qualify for both mortgages if income supports it
- Portfolio loan option if debt-to-income is tight

**Qualification:**
Unity can make portfolio exception for DTI if:
- Property is actively listed with realtor
- Property is priced appropriately (will sell)
- Customer has good reserves
- Market conditions support sale

**Payoff:**
When original home sells:
- Bridge loan paid off from sale proceeds
- Customer keeps new home mortgage
- Seamless transition

### Home Equity Loans (Separate Department)

**Pat's Role:**
Pat doesn't handle home equity loans directly - Unity has a separate department.

**When Customers Need Home Equity:**
- Renovations/improvements
- Debt consolidation
- Emergency expenses
- College tuition

**Process:**
Pat refers to Unity's home equity department, which offers:
- Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC)
- Home Equity Loans (fixed)
- Competitive rates
- Fast approval process

**Agent Benefit:**
If customer needs equity for down payment but doesn't want bridge loan:
- Can do home equity loan first
- Use proceeds for down payment
- Simpler structure than bridge
- Good for customers not in rush to move

### When to Suggest Bridge Loans

**Ideal Scenarios:**
1. **Competitive Market:**
   - Multiple offers common
   - All-cash offers winning
   - Customer needs to compete without sale contingency

2. **Substantial Equity:**
   - Customer has enough equity to cover down payment
   - Current home value significantly higher than mortgage
   - Can support two mortgages temporarily

3. **Strong Income:**
   - Can qualify for both mortgages simultaneously
   - Or qualifies with portfolio exception knowing sale is imminent
   - Good reserves to cover carrying costs

4. **Motivated Move:**
   - Job relocation
   - Family needs (school, aging parents, etc.)
   - Dream home available now

**When NOT to Suggest:**
1. Current home equity insufficient
2. Customer can't carry two mortgages (even temporarily)
3. Current home not priced to sell quickly
4. Customer uncomfortable with risk

### Agent Talking Points

**For Customers Worried About Selling First:**
> "Bridge loans let you compete with all-cash offers. You can make non-contingent offer, which sellers prefer, while keeping your current home on the market. If it's the right house, don't lose it waiting to sell first."

**For Customers Concerned About Carrying Two Mortgages:**
> "The bridge loan is interest-only, so payments are lower than you think. And statistically, homes in our market sell within 60 days. You're only carrying both for a short time. The equity you're using is your own money - you're just accessing it early."

**For Customers Who Lost Deal Due to Contingency:**
> "Next time, let's talk to Pat about a bridge loan. Sellers are 80% more likely to accept non-contingent offers. If you have equity in your current home, we can structure it so you can compete with cash buyers."

## Creative Collateral Strategies

### Using Existing Property as Collateral

Unity Bank's portfolio lending allows creative solutions that conventional lenders cannot offer.

**Scenario: Need Down Payment, Have Property Equity**

**Example:**
```
Customer Situation:
- Owns $700,000 investment property (no mortgage)
- Wants to buy new $600,000 primary residence
- Only has $30,000 in cash savings (5% down)
- Conventional requires 3-20% down ($18,000-$120,000)

Unity's Solution:
- Put lien on existing investment property ($700K)
- Use property as collateral
- Now customer only needs 10% down on new home ($60,000)
- Savings: $30K + $30K from collateral = $60K down payment
- Close deal that conventional lender couldn't
```

**How It Works:**
- Unity files lien on investment property
- Lien gives Unity security interest in property
- If customer defaults, Unity has claim on investment property
- Customer doesn't have to sell or refinance investment property
- Just provides additional security for new loan

### LLC Loans - Residential Treatment

**The Problem with Most Banks:**
When you own property in an LLC (Limited Liability Company), most banks treat it as a **commercial loan**:
- Higher interest rates
- Shorter terms (5-15 years, not 30 years)
- Balloon payments
- **Prepayment penalties** (often 3-5% if you pay off early)

**Unity's Advantage - NJ State Law:**
> "If it's one to 4 family it's our money you can put in an LLC and there's no prepayment penalty because in the state of New Jersey it's illegal to have a prepayment penalty under residential loan"

**New Jersey Law:**
NJ considers 1-4 family properties as **residential**, even in LLC, making prepayment penalties illegal on residential loans.

**Unity's Approach:**
- Treats 1-4 family LLC as residential loan
- 30-year fixed term available
- No prepayment penalty
- **1 point closing fee** (1% of loan amount)
- Market rates (slightly higher than conventional)

**Investor Advantage:**
```
Scenario: Buy 2-family in LLC for rental income

Most Banks:
- 15-year term
- 7% rate
- 5% prepayment penalty if you pay off in 5 years
- On $500K loan = $25,000 penalty to refinance or sell

Unity Bank:
- 30-year fixed
- ~6.75% rate
- 1 point ($5,000) at closing
- $0 prepayment penalty
- Can refinance or sell anytime without penalty
```

**Why This Matters:**
Real estate investors want flexibility. Market changes, property appreciates, rates drop - they need ability to refinance or sell without penalties. Unity provides this flexibility that other banks don't.

### Construction Loans with LLC

**Unique Feature:**
Unity allows construction loans in LLC structure with residential treatment:
- 30-year fixed at completion
- No prepayment penalty
- Builder can be the owner
- First-time builders accepted

**Other Banks:**
Construction loans in LLC typically treated as commercial:
- Higher rates
- Shorter terms
- Prepayment penalties
- Must be experienced builder

### Multiple Property Strategies

**Cross-Collateralization:**
Customer owns several properties with equity. Unity can:
- Use equity from multiple properties
- Secure one new purchase loan
- Spread risk across multiple assets
- Gives customer buying power without cash down payment

**Example:**
```
Customer owns:
- Property A: $400K value, $200K mortgage = $200K equity
- Property B: $350K value, $100K mortgage = $250K equity
- Property C: $300K value, $150K mortgage = $150K equity
Total Equity: $600K

Wants to buy Property D: $500K

Unity Solution:
- Put liens on Properties A, B, C
- Use combined equity as collateral
- Customer only needs 10-15% cash down ($50K-$75K)
- Rest secured by existing equity
```

**Benefits:**
- Preserves cash for reserves and renovations
- Doesn't require selling or refinancing existing properties
- Keeps financing simple on new purchase
- Investor builds portfolio without depleting cash

### Foreign Income and Assets

**Challenge:**
Customers with foreign income or assets held overseas struggle with conventional lenders because:
- Income documentation different
- Can't verify employment through US systems
- Assets held in foreign banks
- Currency conversion issues

**Unity's Portfolio Solution:**
- Will review foreign tax returns
- Can verify foreign bank statements
- Understands currency conversion
- Case-by-case underwriting

**Process:**
1. Customer provides foreign documentation
2. Pat sends to special underwriting team
3. Team reviews and requests any additional docs
4. Portfolio loan approval based on full picture
5. Currency-adjusted income used for qualification

**Requirements:**
- Still needs 20-25% down
- Good credit (US credit if established, foreign credit reports if not)
- Reserves in accessible accounts
- Clear explanation of income source

### When to Suggest Creative Collateral

**Ideal Candidates:**
- Real estate investors with multiple properties
- Business owners with commercial property equity
- Customers with assets but not liquid cash
- Foreign nationals with overseas income/assets
- Buyers who need to act fast without selling first

**Agent Questions to Ask:**
1. "Do you own any other properties?"
2. "Do you have equity in other real estate?"
3. "Are any properties owned free and clear?"
4. "Would you consider using existing property as additional security?"

**When to Call Pat:**
Don't try to structure these yourself. Call Pat when:
- Customer has complicated asset picture
- Multiple properties involved
- LLC structure needed
- Foreign income/assets
- Non-traditional qualifying factors

Pat and Unity's underwriting team will determine best structure and pricing.

## Condo Questionnaire Requirements

### The Miami Collapse Impact

**What Happened:**
Three years ago, the Surfside condominium collapsed in Miami, killing 98 people. This tragedy resulted from deferred maintenance, structural issues, and inadequate inspections.

**Fannie Mae's Response:**
Fannie Mae immediately added new requirement:
- **Engineering inspection requirement** for all condo developments
- Condo associations must complete detailed questionnaire
- Must include engineering certification of structural integrity
- Without questionnaire OR Fannie Mae approval, cannot get conventional loan

### Current Condo Financing Reality

**Pre-Miami:**
- Many condo developments were "Fannie Mae Approved"
- Approval meant streamlined financing
- Questionnaire still required but less rigorous
- Most condos easily financeable

**Post-Miami (Current 2025):**
- **VERY FEW condos are Fannie Mae Approved anymore**
- Developments must pay for expensive engineering inspections
- Many condo associations refuse to pay for inspections
- Management companies unwilling to sign off on engineering certification (liability concerns)
- Result: Most condos now require **portfolio loan**

> "Post-Miami collapse (3 years ago), Fannie Mae added engineering inspection requirement. VERY FEW condos are Fannie Mae approved anymore."

### The Condo Questionnaire

**What It Includes:**
1. **Development Information:**
   - Total units
   - How many owner-occupied vs rented
   - HOA fee structure
   - Reserve fund status
   - Pending litigation
   - Insurance coverage

2. **Financial Health:**
   - HOA budget
   - Delinquency rates
   - Special assessments planned or current
   - Reserve fund adequacy

3. **Engineering Certification (NEW):**
   - Structural integrity certification
   - Recent engineering inspection report
   - Deferred maintenance plan
   - Safety compliance

**Who Completes It:**
- Management company typically fills out form
- But management companies NOW use automated system
- "Condo Search" - automated questionnaire system
- Every mortgage company uses same system

**The Problem:**
Management companies and condo association attorneys are **REFUSING** to sign off on engineering section due to liability concerns. If they certify structural integrity and something happens, they could be liable.

### The Cambridge Heights Story

**Jordan McGovern's Deal (Mahwah Agent):**
- Customer wanted condo in Cambridge Heights, Clifton
- Development has 5 sections
- **4 out of 5 sections were Fannie Mae approved**
- Customer's condo was in the **one section NOT approved**

**Pat's Reaction:**
> "I felt so bad I actually went there... they refused to fill out that part of the question here even though the the stupid engineering was done and they refused to do it"

**The Result:**
- Had to use portfolio loan instead of conventional
- Customer paid slightly higher rate
- But deal closed - just different loan product

**The Irony:**
Engineering inspection WAS completed. Management simply refused to certify it on the form due to liability concerns.

### Finding Out If Condo Is Approved

**Agent's Process:**
1. Get full condo development name from listing
2. Provide to Pat/Alexandra
3. Pat's processor looks it up on Fannie Mae website
4. Processor checks "approved list"

**Important Detail:**
- Same development can have different sections with different approval status
- Must provide exact section/building/phase
- "Cambridge Heights" ≠ "Cambridge Heights Georgetown Section"

**Timeline:**
- Takes 1-2 business days to research
- Critical to do BEFORE making offer
- Can impact financing terms and buyer qualification

### Portfolio Loan for Condos

**When Conventional Won't Work:**
If condo is NOT Fannie Mae approved AND association won't complete questionnaire:
- Must use portfolio loan
- Unity Bank will lend on condo without Fannie Mae approval

**Portfolio Condo Requirements:**
- 20% down payment (vs 3-5% conventional)
- 680+ credit score
- Standard income verification
- Good HOA financial health (Unity still reviews)
- Rate: 0.25-0.75% higher than conventional

**What Unity Reviews:**
Even without Fannie Mae approval, Unity still wants to see:
- HOA budget and reserves
- Delinquency rates below 15%
- No major pending litigation
- Insurance coverage adequate
- No special assessments pending (or if yes, how funded)

### Agent Strategy for Condo Buyers

**Before Showing Condos:**
1. **Check Fannie Mae Approval Status:**
   - Get development name from listing agent
   - Ask Pat to check approval status
   - Know before customer falls in love with unit

2. **Qualify Buyer for Portfolio if Needed:**
   - If most condos in area not approved, pre-qualify for portfolio
   - Ensure customer has 20% down
   - Credit score 680+
   - Comfortable with slightly higher rate

3. **Set Expectations:**
   - Explain post-Miami landscape to buyers
   - Many beautiful condos require portfolio loans now
   - It's not a reflection on property quality
   - Just financing landscape due to liability concerns

**For Listing Agents:**
1. **Disclose Approval Status:**
   - Find out if development is Fannie Mae approved
   - Include in listing if approved (selling point!)
   - If not approved, prepare for portfolio loan discussions

2. **Have HOA Documents Ready:**
   - Recent budget
   - Reserve fund status
   - Insurance coverage
   - Delinquency rates
   - Any special assessments

3. **Work with Pat-Friendly Agents:**
   - Agents who understand portfolio loans
   - Won't kill deal over higher rate
   - Can explain to buyers clearly

### The Future of Condo Financing

**Likely Trends:**
- More developments will get engineering inspections completed (eventually)
- As older condos pass inspections, may return to approved list
- But management liability concerns will persist
- Portfolio loans will remain common for condos for foreseeable future

**Agent Adaptation:**
- Don't avoid condos - they're still good investments
- Just qualify buyers differently
- Work with portfolio lenders like Unity
- Educate buyers on post-Miami landscape

## Construction Loans

### Construction Loan Formula

**Basic Formula:**
```
Purchase Price + Construction Costs = Total Cost

Unity Lends: 70% of Total Cost (builders) OR 75% of Total Cost (owner-occupied)
```

**Example (Builder):**
```
Land Purchase Price: $200,000
Construction Budget: $300,000
Total Cost: $500,000

Unity Lends: 70% × $500,000 = $350,000
Builder Must Provide: 30% = $150,000

How it works:
- Unity lends $200K for land purchase
- Builder provides $150K before construction begins
- Once builder has invested their 30% ($150K), Unity releases construction draws
```

**Example (Owner-Occupied):**
```
Land Purchase Price: $200,000
Construction Budget: $400,000
Total Cost: $600,000

Unity Lends: 75% × $600,000 = $450,000
Homeowner Must Provide: 25% = $150,000

How it works:
- Unity lends $200K for land purchase
- Homeowner provides $150K before construction begins (some flexibility on timing)
- Unity releases construction draws as work progresses
- When complete, refinances to permanent 30-year mortgage
```

### Bob Jenny - The Construction King

**Track Record:**
- 80+ construction loans with Pat in last 8 years
- Based in Ridgewood area
- Top-quality builder
- Excellent working relationship with Unity

**Why This Matters:**
Unity has proven track record with construction lending, not just theoretical program.

### Builder Requirements (or Lack Thereof!)

**Most Banks Require:**
- 3+ previous construction projects completed
- Proven track record
- References and portfolio
- Experience and expertise

**Unity Bank (The Bumble Bank):**
> "We're a bumble whatever bank from Clinton NJ So in any other place does a builder need to have at least three projects done? Not our place if you got to build it 1st time and trying it we'll let you do it"

**First-Time Builder Friendly:**
- No previous project requirement
- Customer can be their own GC (General Contractor)
- Will work with first-time builders
- Focus on financial strength, not experience

**Requirements:**
- 30% down (builders) or 25% (owner-occupied)
- Good credit (680+)
- Detailed construction budget
- Architectural plans
- Builder must invest their portion BEFORE Unity releases construction funds

### Construction Timeline

**Typical Build:** 12 months

**Draw Schedule:**
Construction draws released as work progresses:
1. Foundation poured → Draw #1
2. Framing complete → Draw #2
3. Roof on, dried in → Draw #3
4. Mechanicals roughed in → Draw #4
5. Drywall complete → Draw #5
6. Completion → Final draw

**Inspection Process:**
- Unity's inspector visits at each draw stage
- Verifies work completed
- Ensures quality and progress
- Releases next draw

### Rate Lock Challenge

**The Problem:**
- Typical build takes 12 months
- Cannot lock interest rate for 12 months
- Rate locks available: 30, 45, 75, 90 days only
- Longest Unity offers: 75-90 days

**Why No 12-Month Lock:**
Market too volatile. If rates are 6% today and drop to 4.5% in 12 months, lender loses money. If rates rise to 8%, lender makes windfall. No lender offers true 12-month locks.

**The Solution:**
- Customer locks rate when construction nears completion
- Approximately 30-45 days before completion
- Refinance happens after Certificate of Occupancy (CO) issued
- Lock rate at that time for permanent mortgage

### Construction to Permanent Process

**Old System (Pre-2015):**
- Construction loan automatically converted to 30-year mortgage
- Rate locked at beginning
- Simple conversion process

**Current System (2015-Present):**
- Construction loan is separate
- Must refinance to permanent mortgage at completion
- Two separate transactions
- Why? Rate volatility makes 12-month locks impossible

**Refinance Requirements:**
1. **New Appraisal:**
   - Based on completed home (not plans)
   - "As-completed" appraisal
   - Must support loan amount

2. **New Title Work:**
   - Updated title search
   - Ensure no new liens
   - Clear to close

3. **Final Income Verification:**
   - Customer's income hasn't changed
   - Still employed
   - No new debts incurred during build

4. **Certificate of Occupancy (CO):**
   - Home must pass all inspections
   - CO issued by township
   - Proves home is habitable and code-compliant

**Timeline:**
- One month before completion, start refinance process
- Lock rate at that time
- Close on permanent mortgage within 30 days of completion

### Owner Can Be GC

**Unique Unity Advantage:**
Customer can act as their own General Contractor:
- Hire subcontractors directly
- Manage construction process
- Save GC markup (typically 10-20%)

**Requirements:**
- Customer must be organized and capable
- Must provide detailed budget
- Must coordinate all trades
- Still subject to Unity's inspection and draw schedule

**Risk:**
Not for everyone. Construction management is complex. Customer must understand:
- Scheduling
- Permits and inspections
- Trade coordination
- Budget management
- Timeline management

### Construction Loan Fees

**Closing Costs:**
- **1 point** (1% of loan amount)
- Standard closing costs (title, appraisal, etc.)
- Example: $500K construction loan = $5,000 point + closing costs

**Why 1 Point:**
Construction loans are high-touch, labor-intensive:
- Multiple inspections
- Draw management
- Risk management
- Specialized underwriting

### When to Suggest Construction Loans

**Ideal Scenarios:**
1. **Teardown and Rebuild:**
   - Customer loves location, not house
   - Wants custom home on existing lot
   - Has equity in current home or cash

2. **Land Purchase + Build:**
   - Customer found perfect lot
   - Wants to build dream home
   - Has 25-30% cash to invest

3. **Major Addition:**
   - Existing home too small
   - Second story addition
   - Substantial renovation (gut rehab)

4. **Builder Clients:**
   - Spec home builders
   - Custom home builders
   - First-time builders with capital

**When to Call Pat:**
- Customer mentions "building" or "construction"
- Teardown property being considered
- Land purchase for future build
- Major renovation (over $100K)

Don't try to structure construction loans yourself - let Pat handle the complex details.

## Junk Fees and Rate Analysis

### Understanding the Mortgage Industry

**Two Types of Lenders:**

**1. Mortgage Banks/Brokers:**
- Only do mortgages (not a bank with deposits)
- Must sell every loan to make money
- Make profit through:
  - Rate markup (higher rate = higher commission)
  - Junk fees (extra fees added to closing costs)
- Loan officers paid more for higher rates and more fees

**2. Portfolio Banks (Like Unity):**
- Full-service bank with deposit accounts
- Can keep loans on books (portfolio) or sell them
- Loan officers paid percentage of loan amount (flat fee)
- No incentive to charge junk fees or inflate rates
- Same pay whether 0 points or 2 points charged

### Common Junk Fees to Watch For

| Fee Name | What It Is | Typical Charge | Unity Charges |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Origination Fee** | Fee to process loan | 0.5-1% of loan | $0 |
| **Discount Points** | Upfront fee to lower rate | 1-3% of loan | $0 (unless requested) |
| **Commitment Fee** | Fee to issue commitment | $500-$1,500 | $0 |
| **Underwriting Fee** | Fee for underwriting | $500-$1,000 | $0 |
| **Title Review Fee** | Fee to review title | $300-$600 | $0 |
| **Doc Prep Fee** | Fee to prepare docs | $200-$500 | $0 |
| **Rate Lock Fee** | Fee to lock interest rate | $300-$800 | $0 |
| **Application Fee** | Fee to apply | $0-$1,095 | $1,095* |

*Unity's $1,095 application fee is WAIVED for Christie's agents

### The Rocket Mortgage $17,000 Story

**Customer's Situation:**
- Received pre-approval from Rocket Mortgage
- Rate quoted: 5.75%
- Customer excited: "Pat, why is your rate 6%? Rocket has 5.75%!"

**Pat's Response:**
> "Can I look at your loan estimate?"

**What Pat Found:**
```
Loan Amount: $600,000
Rate: 5.75%
Payment: $3,500/month

But... Closing Costs: $17,000 in FEES
(Normal closing costs: $8,000-$10,000)
Extra Junk Fees: $7,000-$9,000

Pat's Math:
- Rate difference: 5.75% vs 6% = Payment difference of ~$100/month
- Customer saves: $100/month × 24 months (before refi) = $2,400
- Customer pays: $7,000 extra in junk fees upfront
- Net loss: $4,600

Even over 5 years: $100/month × 60 months = $6,000 saved
Still losing: $1,000
Plus customer will likely refinance in 18-24 months anyway!
```

**Pat's Explanation to Customer:**
> "Wait you can pay $17,000 each to save say $200... you're going to refine the next worst case scenario 24 months 200 × 24 months is 4800 bucks you're not going to in order to get to that 17,000 it's going to take you whatever five years and in five years you might have refried twice already and pain double the closing costs"

**Customer's Realization:**
Rocket is a call center. Different person every time. High-pressure sales. Buried junk fees in fine print. Customer had no idea they were paying points.

### How to Spot Junk Fees - The APR Method

**APR = Annual Percentage Rate**

The APR is ALWAYS higher than the interest rate because it includes closing costs in the calculation.

**The Formula:**
```
Higher APR vs Rate = More Fees Charged

Example 1 (Low Fees):
Rate: 6.00%
APR: 6.15%
Difference: 0.15% → LOW fees

Example 2 (High Fees/Junk Fees):
Rate: 5.75%
APR: 6.45%
Difference: 0.70% → HIGH junk fees!
```

> "The APR is always higher than the payments based off the initial rate... the higher the APR compared to the original rate means that the more fees that they're charging you"

**Agent Teaching Point:**
Tell customers: "Don't just compare rates. Compare the APR. If one lender's APR is much higher than their rate, they're hiding junk fees."

### Chase Bank Jumbo Exception

**When Chase Beats Everyone:**
High net worth clients with private equity accounts at Chase.

**The Benzel Bush Story:**
Customer got 5.75% from Chase when Pat quoted 6.5%.

**Why?**
- Customer's uncle owns Benzel Busch auto dealership
- Hundreds of millions in auto loan business with Chase
- Personal banking relationship with millions on deposit
- Chase gave rate "nobody else could get because of the relationship"

**Pat's Takeaway:**
> "If you happen to have a high net worth in your client and they have a tremendous amount of money in that institution it would be hard to [compete on] jumbo loan"

**Agent Strategy:**
If customer has $2M+ at Chase, Wells Fargo, or Bank of America in private equity:
- Let them shop rate with their bank first
- They may get exceptional rate due to relationship
- Don't fight it - you can't compete with that
- Rare exception, not the norm

### Educating Customers on Rate Shopping

**Wrong Way to Shop:**
Customer calls 5 lenders:
- Lender A: "5.75%"
- Lender B: "6%"
- Lender C: "6.125%"
- Lender D: "5.625%"
- Lender E: "6.25%"

Customer picks Lender D because lowest rate.

**Problem:**
- Lender D rate is fake (points and junk fees hidden)
- Lender D might be lying to get application
- Rate changes once customer committed

**Right Way to Shop:**
Customer gets LOAN ESTIMATES from all lenders:
- Compare interest rate
- Compare APR
- Compare closing costs line by line
- Compare total cash to close
- Compare company reputation and service

**Red Flags:**
- Rate more than 0.5% below others
- APR much higher than rate
- Won't provide Loan Estimate upfront
- Pressure to apply immediately
- Different person every time you call

### Pat's Rate Philosophy

**Honest Pricing:**
> "Listen the one thing you're gonna get from us you're gonna know your rate and your fees from day one the only thing you're gonna get better if the rates get better"

**Rate Lock Benefits:**
- If rates go up after locking: Customer protected
- If rates go down after locking: **Unity gives customer the lower rate for FREE**
- No rate lock fee
- No fee to relock at lower rate

**Most Competitors:**
- Charge $300-$800 to lock rate
- Charge $300-$800 to relock if rates drop
- Or won't relock at all

### When You Should Pay Points

**Pat's Rule:**
> "In today's market no customer should be paying any points on the traditional loan unless they need it to buy down the rate to qualify for the mortgage"

**Only Pay Points If:**
1. **DTI Problem:**
   - Customer at 49% DTI
   - Buying down rate from 6.5% to 6% drops payment enough to get under 50% DTI
   - Only way to qualify
   - Customer has extra cash for points

2. **Planning to Keep Long-Term (10+ years):**
   - Customer 100% sure staying in home forever
   - Math works: Points paid back through lower payment over 10 years
   - But risk: What if you refinance in 3 years? Lost money.

**Why NOT to Pay Points:**
- Most customers refinance every 18-24 months
- Break-even typically 4-5 years
- Waste of money if refi before break-even

**Example:**
```
Loan Amount: $700,000
1 Point = $7,000

Rate without points: 6.5% = $4,427/month
Rate with 1 point: 6.0% = $4,198/month
Savings: $229/month

Break-even: $7,000 ÷ $229 = 30.5 months (2.5 years)

If you refinance in 24 months: LOST $2,500
If you keep for 3 years: Saved $1,244
If you keep for 5 years: Saved $6,740
```

But statistically, 70% of mortgages refinance within 3 years. Not worth it.

## Seller Concessions Strategy

### What Are Seller Concessions?

**Definition:**
Seller concessions are when the seller agrees to pay a portion of the buyer's closing costs. This is done by RAISING the sales price and having the seller credit money back to the buyer on paper.

**Important:** The credit is a PAPER CREDIT on the closing disclosure, not a check handed to the buyer.

### How Seller Concessions Work

**Example:**
```
Buyer's Situation:
- Has 5% down payment saved: $25,000
- Does NOT have closing costs: $15,000 needed
- Total cash needed: $40,000
- Only has: $25,000

Solution - Seller Concession:
Step 1: Raise sales price by $15,000
- Original agreed price: $500,000
- New contract price: $515,000

Step 2: Add language to contract
- "Sales Price: $515,000"
- "Additional Comments: $15,000 seller concession towards buyer's closing costs"

Step 3: Buyer brings down payment only
- 5% of $515,000 = $25,750
- Closing costs ($15,000) credited on closing disclosure
- Buyer brings: ~$25,750 vs original $40,000

Step 4: Two things must happen:
✅ House must APPRAISE for $515,000
✅ Buyer must QUALIFY income-wise for $515,000 loan
```

**Key Point:**
The seller still gets their original $500,000. The extra $15,000 goes to pay closing costs, so it's a wash for the seller. But buyer can proceed without the extra $15,000 cash.

### Maximum Seller Concession Limits (Conventional Loans)

**By Down Payment Percentage:**

| Down Payment | Maximum Concession |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 5% down | 3% of purchase price |
| 10-15% down | 3% of purchase price |
| 10-25% down | Up to 6% of purchase price |
| 25%+ down | Up to 9% of purchase price |

**Examples:**
```
$500,000 Purchase, 5% Down:
Maximum concession: $500,000 × 3% = $15,000

$500,000 Purchase, 25% Down:
Maximum concession: $500,000 × 9% = $45,000
```

**Pat's Caveat:**
> "I've never done a loan in 25 years [with 9%] because sometimes sometimes it isn't even foreclosing costs"

Closing costs rarely reach 9% of purchase price unless it's a very low-priced home or unusual situation.

### FHA Seller Concessions

**FHA Limits:**
- Can request seller concessions on FHA loans
- But **CANNOT explicitly state it's for repairs**
- Must be labeled "towards closing costs"

**Why This Matters:**
FHA used to allow repair credits. Now they don't. But you can still use seller concessions creatively.

### Using Seller Concessions for Repair Credits

**The Problem:**
After home inspection, $10,000 in repairs needed. Buyer doesn't have extra $10,000 cash.

**Old Method (No Longer Allowed):**
```
Contract: "$500,000 with $10,000 repair credit"
CD Shows: "Repair Credit: $10,000"
```
❌ **THIS IS NOW ILLEGAL** - Cannot have "repair credit" on Closing Disclosure

**New Method (Current Legal Way):**
```
Contract Addendum:
"Sales Price: $500,000
Seller Concession: $10,000 towards buyer's closing costs"

Closing Disclosure Shows:
"Seller Credit: $10,000 towards closing costs"
```

✅ **LEGAL** - It's a seller concession, not a repair credit

**What Actually Happens:**
- Buyer gets $10,000 credit on CD
- Closing costs only $7,000
- Buyer brings $3,000 less to closing
- Buyer uses saved $10,000 for repairs after closing
- Or buyer reduces purchase price by $3,000 through addendum

> "You can't put a repair credit on your CD the closing disclosure... you cannot have a repair credit used to be able to yes but not anymore not anymore so how do we do it We put a seller concession"

### When to Use Seller Concessions

**Scenario 1: Buyer Lacks Closing Cost Money**
- Has down payment saved
- Doesn't have extra $10,000-$15,000 for closing costs
- Add seller concession to cover closing costs

**Scenario 2: Inspection Repairs Needed**
- Septic system needs $5,000 repair
- HVAC needs $8,000 replacement
- Use seller concession instead of repair credit

**Scenario 3: Multiple Offer Strategy**
- Market is competitive
- Buyer wants to offer higher price to win
- But doesn't have extra cash
- Raise offer price, add seller concession
- Net to seller stays same
- But looks like higher offer on paper

### Seller Concession Negotiation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Upfront in Offer**
```
Offer: $500,000 with $15,000 seller concession

Seller sees: $500,000 price (attractive)
Seller realizes: Net is $485,000 after concession
But seller knows: Buyer serious and can close
```

**Strategy 2: After Inspection**
```
Original Offer: $500,000
Inspection Issues: $12,000 repairs
Addendum: Add $12,000 seller concession
New Contract: $500,000 with $12,000 concession
```

**Strategy 3: Creative Home Inspection Approach**
When using seller concession in original offer:
- Raise price by concession amount
- Add seller concession
- BUT limit home inspection to structural only
- Why? You've already built in $ for repairs via concession

**Example:**
```
Home Value: $500,000
Offer: $515,000 with $15,000 concession (net $500K to seller)
Inspection: Structural only (no HVAC, no cosmetic)

Result:
- Seller gets their $500K
- Buyer gets $15K for whatever issues arise
- Deal less likely to fall apart over inspection items
- Everyone wins
```

**Fern's Wisdom:**
> "You could let's say you're selling a house you're bringing in an offer you raise the price to put in a seller concession but then knowing that you're going to get that concession you make your home inspection really limited because they'll probably be something but you can't say it anyway so now you have maybe only structural on your home inspection"

This is ADVANCED negotiating - consult with experienced agents before using this strategy.

### Seller Concession Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Over the Maximum**
Asked for $20,000 concession on 5% down purchase:
- Maximum allowed: 3% of purchase price
- $500K purchase × 3% = $15,000 max
- **Cannot go to $20,000** - Fannie Mae won't allow

**Pitfall 2: Won't Appraise**
Raised price $15,000 for concession but:
- Appraisal comes in at original price ($500K)
- New price ($515K) doesn't appraise
- Deal falls apart or needs renegotiation

**Prevention:** Pat asks agent upfront:
> "Do you think the household appraise for $515K?"

Agent must do homework - check recent comps to ensure raised price will appraise.

**Pitfall 3: Excess Concession Money**
Asked for $15,000 concession but closing costs only $12,000:
- **Old days:** Some lenders gave buyer check for $3,000 difference (illegal)
- **Current rule:** Must reduce loan amount by excess

**Solution:**
```
Original: $515,000 price with $15,000 concession
Closing costs: Only $12,000 needed

Adjustment:
New contract: $512,000 with $12,000 concession
OR
Keep at $515,000 but reduce concession to $12,000

Cannot: Give buyer cash difference
```

> "They never did it and if they did it was illegal... we will reduce it to $8,000 instead of increasing your $110 we're going to [reduce to] $108 because I don't want that to [go away]... it goes in the air completely"

**Pitfall 4: Attorney Doesn't Understand**
Some attorneys try to put "repair credit" on contract:
- Cannot do this anymore
- Must be "seller concession towards closing costs"
- Lender will reject loan if "repair credit" on CD

**What Happens:**
> "I've had gotten into flights with lawyers where no I put a repair credit you can't well then I'm not going to do it anyway then the next phone call is Fern we have a problem"

Pat will call the agent: "Attorney won't change it from repair credit. Please explain to attorney this is federal law, not Pat being difficult."

### Seller Concession Talking Points

**For Sellers:**
> "The buyer is asking for $15,000 seller concession. This means we raise the price to $515,000, you credit $15,000 towards their closing costs. You still net your $500,000. The alternative is they ask you to reduce the price $15,000 instead. This way, the home shows as selling for $515,000, which helps your neighborhood comps."

**For Buyers:**
> "You don't have the extra $15,000 for closing costs. We can ask the seller for a concession. We raise the offer price $15,000, seller credits it back to you. You only need your down payment. As long as the house appraises for the higher price and you qualify income-wise, this solves your cash problem."

**For Multiple Offers:**
> "We're competing against 3 other offers. Let's offer $515,000 with $15,000 seller concession. This looks like a higher offer than the $500,000 offers. Net to seller is $500,000 - same as others - but we stand out. And you get your closing costs covered."

### Advanced: Seller Concession for FHA/VA Buyers

**FHA/VA Challenge:**
FHA and VA buyers often have minimal down payment (3.5% FHA, 0% VA) but also lack closing cost money.

**Solution:**
- Raise price for seller concession
- But FHA/VA appraisals can be strict
- Must be confident property will appraise at higher value

**Strategy:**
Work with Pat upfront:
1. Tell Pat buyer is FHA/VA and needs seller concession
2. Pat will analyze if price increase is supportable
3. If yes, structure deal with concession
4. If no, may need seller to actually pay costs (less common)

---

## Pre-Approval Process

### Pat's Detailed Pre-Qualification Questions

Unlike many lenders who issue pre-approvals after brief phone calls, Pat asks extensive questions BEFORE issuing letter:

**Income Questions:**
1. "How much do you make per year?"
2. "Is that W2, commission-based, or self-employed?"
3. If commission: "What's your base salary vs commission split?"
4. If commission: "What's your average commission over last 2 years?"
5. If self-employed: "Can I see your 2-year business tax returns?"
6. If self-employed: "What's your gross revenue vs net income shown on taxes?"

**Debt Questions:**
1. "What monthly debts do you have?" (car loans, student loans, credit cards)
2. "Any child support or alimony payments?"
3. "Any additional properties you own with mortgages?"

**Down Payment Questions:**
1. "How much do you have for down payment and closing costs?"
2. "Is the money currently in YOUR bank account?"
3. "Has it been there for at least 2 months?"
4. "Are you receiving gift money from family?"
   - If yes: "Leave it there, don't deposit yet - I'll tell you how to handle it"

**Credit Questions:**
1. "What's your approximate credit score?"
2. "Any bankruptcies or foreclosures in past 7 years?"
3. "Any late payments in past 2 years?"

**Property Questions:**
1. "What type of property are you looking for?" (1-family, 2-family, condo, etc.)
2. "Owner-occupied or investment?"
3. "What price range?"
4. "Any specific towns or areas?"

### Why Pat Goes Deeper Than Others

**The Problem with Quick Pre-Approvals:**
Many lenders issue letters based on:
- Customer states income: "$200,000/year"
- Lender assumes it's all W2
- Issues letter for $800,000 loan
- Customer makes offer, gets accepted
- **2 weeks later:** Lender discovers income is commission-based, averages $120,000
- **Result:** Customer doesn't actually qualify, deal falls apart

**Pat's Philosophy:**
> "I do my homework before I give our customer the letter... it's not right if you give a letter to customer gets accepted and then you can't do it"

**Pat's Promise:**
> "When I give a letter and we get accepted because I asked a little bit more questions up front... I always close the loans when you get a letter"

### The Self-Employed Discovery

**Common Mistake:**
```
Lender: "How much do you make per year?"
Customer: "$200,000"
Lender: "Great! Here's your pre-approval for $800K loan"

Reality:
Customer is self-employed
Gross revenue: $200,000
After write-offs on taxes: $80,000 net
Actual qualifying income: $80,000
Actual loan approval: $320,000

Result: Deal falls apart, everyone upset
```

**Pat's Approach:**
```
Pat: "How much do you make per year?"
Customer: "$200,000"
Pat: "Are you W2, commission, or self-employed?"
Customer: "Self-employed"
Pat: "Can I see your 2-year business tax returns? I can add depreciation back in."
[Reviews returns]
Pat: "Okay, you show $80K net, but with depreciation add-back, I can use $110K for qualifying"
Pre-approval issued: $440,000 (accurate and achievable)
```

**Key Difference:**
Pat discovers the self-employment situation BEFORE issuing letter, ensuring accuracy.

### Adding Depreciation for Self-Employed

**The Tax Strategy:**
Self-employed borrowers write off expenses to reduce taxable income. This includes depreciation on equipment, vehicles, buildings, etc.

**Problem:**
Depreciation is a paper expense (not actual cash outflow), but it reduces shown income on tax returns.

**Lender Solution:**
Lenders can ADD BACK depreciation because it's not a real expense - it's accounting.

**Example:**
```
Business Tax Return Shows:
Gross Revenue: $500,000
Operating Expenses: -$350,000
Depreciation: -$50,000
Net Income: $100,000

Lender Calculation:
Net Income: $100,000
Add Back Depreciation: +$50,000
Qualifying Income: $150,000

Monthly Qualifying Income: $150,000 ÷ 12 = $12,500/month
```

This can increase loan approval significantly.

### Pre-Approval Letter Accuracy

**Pat's Method:**
- Issues pre-approval for slightly LESS than customer can qualify for
- Example: Customer qualifies for $650K, Pat issues letter for $600K
- Why? Built-in buffer for:
  - Property taxes higher than estimated
  - HOA fees on condos
  - PMI slightly higher than projected
  - Interest rate increase between pre-approval and offer

**Result:**
> "Unless they lose their job or there's an appraisal issue, you will close on that loan"

**Closing Rate:**
Pat claims 95%+ closing rate on pre-approvals issued. Most lenders average 60-70%.

### Listing Agent Verification

**Pat Encourages:**
Listing agents should call Pat directly to verify buyer strength:
- "I've got an offer with your pre-approval letter"
- "Can you tell me about this buyer?"

**What Pat Will Share (Without Violating Privacy):**
- ✅ Credit score range: "Excellent credit, 750+"
- ✅ Income stability: "W2 employee, stable income, 5 years same employer"
- ✅ Down payment: "They have 20% down, verified in bank 2+ months"
- ✅ Reserves: "Good reserves, 6 months mortgage payments in savings"
- ✅ Approval confidence: "This is a no-brainer loan, will close without issues"

**What Pat Won't Share:**
- ❌ Exact income amount
- ❌ Exact credit score
- ❌ Specific bank account balances
- ❌ Personal details (age, family size, etc.)

**Why This Matters:**
In multiple offer situations, listing agents often call lenders to verify buyer strength. Pat's willingness to engage builds trust and increases offer acceptance rate.

### The 4506 Form - Tax Transcript Verification

**What It Is:**
IRS Form 4506-T authorizes lender to pull customer's actual tax returns directly from IRS.

**Old System:**
- Customer signed 4506 form
- But lenders rarely executed it
- Customers could provide fake tax returns
- Fraud was rampant

**Current System (Post-2008):**
- Customer signs 4506 form
- **Lender MUST execute it** (verify with IRS)
- IRS sends official tax transcript
- Lender compares customer-provided returns to IRS transcript
- Any discrepancy = loan denied + fraud reported

**Why This Matters to Agents:**
Tell customers upfront: "Whatever you show the lender will be verified with the IRS. Don't exaggerate or alter tax returns - it's federal fraud."

### Red Flags Pat Watches For

**Bank Statement Red Flags:**
1. **Round Numbers:** $8,567,000.00 (ends in .00 cents)
   - Real bank statements rarely end in .00 due to interest, fees, transactions
   - Indicates possible Photoshop alteration

2. **Fonts Don't Match:** Different font sizes or types on same statement
   - Professional banks use consistent formatting
   - Altered statements often have font mismatches

3. **Large Deposits:** $50,000 suddenly appears
   - Must be sourced and documented
   - Could be cash from under mattress (can't verify)
   - Could be loan from family (creates undisclosed debt)

**The Fake $15M Bank Statement Story:**
- Customer claimed $15M cash in bank
- Buying very expensive home
- Agent felt something off, sent statement to Pat
- Pat noticed: Every balance ended in $.00 (impossible with $15M earning interest)
- Pat asked for 2 months statements
- Customer disappeared
- Statement was fabricated in Photoshop

### Gift Money Procedures

**Wrong Way:**
```
Customer: "My parents are giving me $50,000 for down payment"
[Customer's parents deposit $50K into customer's account immediately]
[2 weeks later, customer applies for mortgage]

Problem:
Lender sees $50K deposit, asks for source
"It's a gift from parents"
Lender says: "Need to verify source, verify it's gift not loan,
verify parents have had money 30+ days in THEIR account"
Parents' account shows: Large cash deposit 1 month ago
Can't verify source = Cannot use money = Deal falls apart
```

**Right Way (Pat's Method):**
```
Customer: "My parents are giving me $50,000 for down payment"
Pat: "Leave it in THEIR account for now. Don't deposit yet."

[House goes under contract]

Pat: "Okay, NOW we'll do the gift:
1. Parents provide recent bank statement (30 days, showing $50K+ balance)
2. Parents sign gift letter (we provide template)
3. Parents wire $50K directly to closing attorney
   OR deposit into customer account and we document transfer

Requirements:
- Money was in parents' account 30+ days (no large recent deposits)
- Gift letter states: 'This is a gift, not a loan, no repayment expected'
- Transfer documented (wire confirmation or deposit receipt)
```

**Gift Letter Language:**
```
"I, [Parent Name], am gifting $50,000 to [Customer Name] for the purchase of
[Property Address]. This is a gift, not a loan. No repayment is expected or
required. I understand this gift will be used towards down payment and/or
closing costs."

Signed: _________________ Date: _________
```

### Overseas Gift Money

**Challenge:**
Family members sending money from overseas (China, India, Korea, Europe, etc.) for down payment.

**Unity's Process:**
- Can accept overseas gifts
- Requires additional documentation:
  - Wire transfer records
  - Currency conversion documentation
  - Gift letter (translated to English if needed)
  - Bank statement from foreign bank (translated)
  - Relationship proof (birth certificate, family registry, etc.)

**Processing Time:**
Add 1-2 weeks for overseas gift verification. Start process EARLY.

## Agent Best Practices

### The Pre-Approval Process for Agents

**Step 1: Get Customer Basic Info**
Don't try to pre-qualify customers yourself. Instead:
- Ask: "Have you been pre-approved yet?"
- If no: "Let me connect you with Pat Grande from Unity Bank"
- **Give Pat the customer's name and phone number** (don't wait for customer to call)

**Why?**
If you tell customer "call Pat," 8 out of 10 won't call for a week (if at all). By giving Pat their info, Pat calls them immediately, shows proactive service.

### The Commission Statement Critical Rule

**⚠️ MOST IMPORTANT DEADLINE:**
Request your commission statement **1 WEEK before closing** and ensure it reaches title company and attorney **MINIMUM 3 days before closing**.

**Why It's Critical:**
- Closing Disclosure (CD) must show agent commissions
- CD must be issued 3 days before closing (federal law)
- If commission statement not received, CD cannot be issued
- **If CD not issued 3 days before, closing CANNOT happen**

**How to Request:**
1. Go to Platform/Zip Forms/My SarcyG (admin system)
2. Request commission statement from Admin
3. Email statement to:
   - Title company (Regency Title)
   - Buyer's attorney
   - Seller's attorney
   - Pat/Alexandra (cc for their records)

**Timeline:**
```
Closing Date: Friday, June 15

June 8 (1 week before): Request commission statement from Admin
June 10-11: Receive commission statement
June 11: Email to title company + attorneys
June 12: Title company prepares CD with commission info
June 12: CD issued (exactly 3 days before closing)
June 15: CLOSING DAY
```

**If You Forget:**
Closing delayed. Customer upset. Everyone blames you. Don't let this happen.

### Use Regency Title (and Why)

**Pat's Requirement:**
Use Regency Title for ALL transactions with Unity Bank customers.

**Benefits:**
1. **Order on Day 1:** Can order title immediately after offer acceptance
   - Attorney review still happening? No problem - order title anyway
   - If deal cancels during attorney review: **NO CHARGE**

2. **Fast Turnaround:** 2-3 weeks vs 4-6 weeks with other title companies

3. **Responsive Service:**
   - Answer phones immediately
   - Agents can call anytime with questions
   - Will help resolve title issues proactively

4. **Early Problem Detection:**
   - Title issues discovered in Week 1, not Week 6
   - More time to resolve problems
   - Prevents last-minute closing delays

5. **Integration with Unity:**
   - Regency and Unity work together frequently
   - Smooth coordination
   - Fewer communication errors

**Example Scenario:**
- Offer accepted Monday
- Order Regency title Tuesday
- Week 2: Title search reveals second mortgage not discharged from 2010
- Problem: Previous owner refinanced, old lien not removed
- Solution: Must go to court to remove lien
- Timeline: 3 weeks to resolve
- **Result:** Still closed on time because discovered early

**If You'd Waited:**
- Week 5: Order title (after attorney review complete)
- Week 7: Discover lien issue
- Now only 1 week to closing - NOT ENOUGH TIME
- **Result:** Closing delayed 2-3 weeks, everyone unhappy

### Open House and Lead Management

**When People Visit Open House:**
- Don't try to pre-qualify them yourself
- Get name, phone, email
- Ask: "Are you pre-approved yet?"
- If no: "Let me connect you with our preferred lender"
- **Give Pat their contact info that day**

**Follow-Up:**
- Pat calls them within 24 hours
- Gets them pre-approved
- Sends YOU the pre-approval letter
- Now you have a qualified buyer to work with

### The "Call Me Anytime" Policy

**Pat's Availability:**
- Office hours: 9am-5pm
- Phone hours: 6pm-11:30pm (really!)
- Weekends: All day (except during kids' soccer games)
- Response time: Minutes to hours, same day guaranteed

**Alexandra's Availability:**
- Similar schedule
- Covers when Pat unavailable
- Bergen County specialist

**How to Reach:**
- Cell phone (provided to all Christie's agents)
- Text message (fastest response)
- Email (responded to within 2-4 hours)
- Office phone (transfers to cell if out)

**Pat's Philosophy:**
> "I didn't get home last night till 11:30 so if you called me I would have picked up the phone... We pick up your phone and answer the question"

**Competitor Comparison:**
- Call Rocket Mortgage at 6pm: Different person every time, reading script
- Call Chase at 7pm: Voicemail, callback next business day (maybe)
- Call Pat at 9pm: Pat answers, solves problem immediately

### The "I'm Not Going to Lie" Promise

**Pat's Commitment:**
> "I'm not going to issue a letter unless I know I can close it... I'm not going to ruin one deal just to make a lie and not close this deal"

**What This Means:**
- If Pat says customer can close in 30 days, they CAN
- If Pat says customer qualifies for $650K, they DO
- If Pat says he'll close the loan, he WILL (unless job loss or property issue)

**Contrast with Competitors:**
Many lenders issue "fake" pre-approvals:
- Haven't pulled credit
- Haven't verified income
- Just trying to get application
- Hope to figure it out later

**Pat's Approach:**
- Pulls credit before issuing letter
- Asks detailed income questions
- Reviews tax returns for self-employed
- Issues accurate, conservative pre-approval
- 95%+ close rate

### When Customer Has Letter from Another Lender

**Don't Be Afraid to Question It:**
- "Have you heard of this bank?"
- "Who's the loan officer?"
- "Have they verified your income yet?"

**Call Pat for Second Opinion:**
- Send Pat the letter
- Pat will review and identify any red flags
- Pat will tell you if it's legitimate or questionable

**Red Flags in Pre-Approval Letters:**
1. **Generic language:** "Pre-qualified" vs "Pre-approved"
2. **No loan officer name/phone:** Just company name
3. **Suspiciously high amount:** Customer makes $80K, approved for $800K
4. **Online lender with no local presence:** Rocket, LendingTree, etc.
5. **No mention of credit check:** "Subject to credit approval"

**When to Suggest Switch to Pat:**
- Letter seems questionable
- Customer having communication problems with lender
- Customer wants faster closing
- Customer needs portfolio loan flexibility
- Customer shopping rates (suggest comparing Pat's terms)

### The 1,000 Miles Per Week Commitment

**Pat's Client Service:**
- Drives 1,000 miles per week throughout Bergen County
- Meets customers face-to-face (not just phone/zoom)
- Visits agents at offices
- Attends Christie's meetings and events
- Available for listing presentations with agents

**Why Face-to-Face Matters:**
- Builds trust with customers
- Customers ask more questions in person
- Pat reads body language and concerns
- Can review documents together
- Personal connection = better experience = more referrals

**Oil Change Story:**
> "1,000 miles a week my mechanic loves me because everybody else I get the 5000 mile oil change everybody else is probably three months i'm there in a month and a half"

This commitment level is RARE in mortgage industry. Most loan officers never meet customers in person.

### Learning from Experienced Agents

**Pat's Advice for New Agents:**
> "Go to the office talk to experienced agents right take their brain... I learned something new every day"

**Specific Suggestions:**
1. **Attend Office Meetings:** Learn from shop talk
2. **Cover Open Houses:** For experienced agents who have multiples
3. **Ask Questions:** Experienced agents happy to teach

- How to work with other agents

## Key Takeaways

### For Real Estate Agents

**Pre-Approval Process:**
1. Get customer's name and phone number
2. Give to Pat/Alexandra (don't wait for customer to call)
3. Pat pre-qualifies thoroughly before issuing letter
4. You receive accurate, reliable pre-approval letter
5. 95%+ close rate on Pat's pre-approvals

**Financing Options to Know:**
- **Conventional:** Best rates, 3-20% down, 50% DTI max
- **FHA:** 3.5% down, lower credit scores, 55% DTI max
- **Portfolio:** Self-employed, high DTI, doesn't fit "box"
- **Bridge:** Use equity before selling current home
- **Construction:** 70-75% loan, first-time builders okay
- **Seller Concessions:** Buyer lacks closing cost money
- **Creative Collateral:** Use other properties as security

**Critical Deadlines:**
- Order title Day 1 (use Regency Title)
- Request commission statement 1 week before closing
- Submit commission statement to title company 3 days before closing
- Closing Disclosure issued 3 days before closing (cannot close without this)

**When to Call Pat:**
- Customer needs pre-approval
- Customer has letter from unknown lender (verify it)
- Appraisal comes in low (Pat has solutions)
- Self-employed customer (needs portfolio loan likely)
- Condo purchase (check Fannie Mae approval)
- Customer needs seller concession
- ANY complicated financing situation

### For Customers (Agent Talking Points)

**Why Use Unity Bank:**

- Pat and Alexandra answer phones 6pm-11:30pm, weekends

- Include closing timeline in letter (competitive advantage)

**What NOT to Do During Mortgage Process:**
- ❌ Don't buy furniture (opens new credit)
- ❌ Don't buy a car (opens new credit, increases DTI)
- ❌ Don't close credit cards (lowers credit score)
- ❌ Don't make large deposits (must be sourced)
- ❌ Don't quit your job (income verification fails)
- ❌ Don't deposit gift money early (sourcing problems)

3. **Relationship Building:** Face-to-face meetings, 1,000 miles/week
4. **Problem Solving:** Creative solutions for challenging situations
5. **Education:** Teach agents and customers the "why" behind processes

**Unity Bank's Difference:**

- CEO makes flexible decisions (Celia story)
- Treats 1-4 family LLC as residential (no prepayment penalty)
- First-time builder friendly
- Second appraisal at Unity's expense if comes in higher
- Rate relock at lower rate for free

### The Bottom Line

**86% of people list with the first agent they speak to - Be first, be memorable, follow up.**

Same applies to lenders:
- Get customer to Pat FIRST before they shop elsewhere
- Pat's service and expertise creates lasting impression
- Customer likely stays with Pat through closing
- Happy customer refers friends and family

**Success Formula:**
```
Great Agent + Great Lender = More Closings

You (Agent) find the house
Pat (Lender) secures the financing
Regency (Title) clears the title
Customer gets keys to new home
Everyone wins
```

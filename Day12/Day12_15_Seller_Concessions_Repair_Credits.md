## Overview

Seller's concessions are one of the most powerful tools in real estate financing, allowing sellers to help buyers with closing costs and repairs. Understanding how to structure and maximize concessions helps agents close more deals, particularly with FHA and VA buyers.

---

## What Are Seller's Concessions?

### Definition

**Seller's Concession:**
Credits from seller to buyer used for:
- Closing costs
- Prepaid items (taxes, insurance)
- Discount points (rate buydown)
- Repairs or improvements
- Financing costs

**How It Works:**
```
Purchase Price: $400,000
Seller Concession: $10,000

Seller's Net:
Sale Price: $400,000
Less Concession: -$10,000
Seller Receives: $390,000

Buyer's Benefit:
Closing Costs: $10,000
Seller Concession: -$10,000
Buyer's Out-of-Pocket: $0 for closing costs
```

---

## Why Seller's Concessions Matter

### Buyer Cash Constraints

**Common Scenario:**
```
Buyer has enough for down payment but SHORT on closing costs

$400,000 Purchase
Down Payment (10%): $40,000 (buyer has this)
Closing Costs: $12,000 (buyer does NOT have this)
Total Needed: $52,000

Buyer's Available: $40,000
Shortfall: $12,000

Without Concession: Deal falls apart
With $12,000 Concession: Deal closes!
```

**Who Benefits Most:**
- First-time buyers
- FHA buyers (3.5% down, limited cash)
- VA buyers (0% down, limited cash)
- Buyers who maxed out down payment savings
- Buyers selling current home simultaneously

---

## Loan Type Concession Limits

### Maximum Allowed by Loan Type

**Conventional Loans:**
```
Owner-Occupied:
- 10%+ down payment → 6% max concession
- 3-9.99% down payment → 3% max concession

Investment Property:
- 2% max concession (regardless of down payment)

Second Home:
- 10%+ down → 6% max
- Less than 10% → 3% max
```

**FHA Loans:**
- **6% maximum concession** (regardless of down payment)
- Most generous for buyers with 3.5% down

**VA Loans:**
- **4% maximum concession**
- Can cover all closing costs
- Very valuable for 0% down buyers

**Examples:**
```
$400,000 FHA Purchase:
Max Concession: $400,000 × 6% = $24,000

$400,000 Conventional 5% down:
Max Concession: $400,000 × 3% = $12,000

$400,000 VA Purchase:
Max Concession: $400,000 × 4% = $16,000
```

---

## The Repair Credit Strategy

### Traditional Approach (PROBLEMATIC)

**Old Way:**
```
Inspection reveals: $8,000 in needed repairs
Contract amendment: "Seller to complete repairs before closing"

Problems:
❌ Seller does cheap/quick repairs (not quality work)
❌ Work not completed on time (delays closing)
❌ Buyer unhappy with workmanship
❌ Re-inspection required
❌ Disputes over completion
```

### Modern Approach (SELLER'S CREDIT)

**Better Way:**
```
Inspection reveals: $8,000 in needed repairs
Contract amendment: "Seller provides $8,000 credit toward buyer's closing costs"

Benefits:
✅ Seller pays $8,000 less at closing (net is same)
✅ Buyer uses credit for closing costs
✅ Buyer fixes repairs themselves (controls quality and timing)
✅ No closing delays
✅ No disputes over workmanship
✅ Everyone wins
```

**Pat's Recommendation:**
> "ALWAYS negotiate repairs as seller's credit toward closing costs, never as 'seller will repair.' You avoid delays, disputes, and poor workmanship. Buyer gets the money, seller saves the hassle, deal closes on time."

## Structuring Concessions for Maximum Benefit

### The Math Strategy

**Scenario: Buyer Needs More Concession Than Seller Wants to Give**

**Initial Situation:**
```
Agreed Price: $400,000
Buyer Needs: $15,000 in concessions
Seller Willing: $8,000 concession

Gap: $7,000
```

**Solution: RAISE THE PRICE**

**Restructured Deal:**
```
New Price: $407,000
Seller Concession: $15,000

Seller's Net:
Sale Price: $407,000
Less Concession: -$15,000
Seller Receives: $392,000
(More than original $400K - $8K = $392K!)

Buyer's Position:
Loan Amount: Higher by $7,000 (spread over 30 years = $45/month)
Closing Costs: Covered by $15,000 concession
Out-of-Pocket: Significantly reduced

Winner: Both parties!
```

**Key Insight:**
> Raising the price to provide bigger concession often helps buyer MORE than it costs them in monthly payment increase. $7,000 spread over 30 years is only ~$45/month but solves $7,000 immediate cash problem.

## FHA and VA Buyer Strategies

### FHA Buyers (3.5% Down)

**Typical FHA Buyer Challenge:**
- Saved enough for 3.5% down payment
- Maxed out savings for down payment
- Has NOTHING left for closing costs

**Solution:**
```
$400,000 Purchase, 3.5% down FHA

Down Payment: $14,000 (buyer has this, barely)
Closing Costs: ~$12,000 (buyer does NOT have)

Offer Structure:
Purchase Price: $412,000
Seller Concession: $12,000 (6% of $400K, or 2.9% of $412K)

Seller's Net: $412,000 - $12,000 = $400,000 (same as original)
Buyer's Down: 3.5% × $412,000 = $14,420 (slightly more)
Buyer's Closing: Covered by $12,000 concession

Result: Deal closes with minimal buyer cash
```

### VA Buyers (0% Down)

**VA Buyer Advantage:**
- 0% down payment required
- 4% max seller concession
- Can cover ALL closing costs

**Powerful Strategy:**
```
$400,000 Purchase, 0% down VA

Down Payment: $0 (VA benefit)
Closing Costs: ~$10,000

Offer Structure:
Purchase Price: $400,000
Seller Concession: $10,000 (2.5% of price)

Seller's Net: $390,000
Buyer's Cash Needed: ZERO (except earnest money deposit)

This is why VA buyers are VERY strong despite 0% down!
```

**Agent Talking Point:**
> "VA buyers with full seller's concession can close with minimal cash out-of-pocket. They're often stronger than they appear because of this benefit."

---

## Appraisal Considerations

### Concession Must Be Supported by Value

**Critical Rule:**
When raising price to provide concession, property MUST appraise at new higher price

**Example:**
```
Original Agreement: $400,000
Restructured: $407,000 + $7,000 concession

If Appraises at $407,000: ✅ Deal works
If Appraises at $402,000: ❌ Problem

Gap: $5,000 between appraisal and contract
Lender will only lend on $402,000
Deal requires restructure or additional buyer cash
```

**Strategy to Support Higher Appraisal:**
1. Provide strong comps to appraiser
2. Highlight property upgrades and features
3. Ensure property shows well for appraisal
4. Don't inflate price beyond supportable range
5. Have backup plan if appraisal comes in low

## How to Present Concessions to Sellers

### Seller Objections

**"I'm not giving the buyer money!"**

**Agent Response:**
> "You're not giving them money - you're adjusting how closing costs are paid. Your net proceeds are exactly the same whether you sell for $400K with no concession or $408K with $8K concession. The difference is whether the deal closes or falls apart because the buyer can't cover closing costs."

**"Why should I pay their closing costs?"**

**Agent Response:**
> "Think of it as a sale price reduction that helps you close the deal. If buyer doesn't have closing costs, your alternative is to start over with a new buyer, carry the house longer, and maybe sell for less. The concession helps this deal close now."

**"That's not fair to me!"**

**Agent Response:**
> "Let's look at your net proceeds:
> - Option 1: $400K sale, $0 concession = $400K net
> - Option 2: $408K sale, $8K concession = $400K net
> - Option 3: Buyer walks, relist, sell in 60 days for $395K = $395K net
> Which option is fairest to YOU?"

## Repair Credit Negotiations

### After Home Inspection

**Inspection Reveals Issues:**
```
Major: $4,000 (roof repair)
Minor: $2,000 (electrical, plumbing)
Cosmetic: $1,500 (paint, flooring)
Total: $7,500
```

**Negotiation Strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Full Credit**
> "Seller provides $7,500 credit toward buyer's closing costs. Buyer handles all repairs post-closing."

**Strategy 2: Shared Credit**
> "Seller provides $5,000 credit (splits major items). Buyer handles minor and cosmetic."

**Strategy 3: Major Items Only**
> "Seller provides $4,000 credit for roof. Buyer accepts property 'as-is' for minor items."

**Strategy 4: Price Reduction**
> "Reduce purchase price by $7,500 in lieu of repairs or credits."

**Pat's Preference: Credit > Price Reduction**

**Why Credit Is Better:**
```
Credit Approach:
- Buyer uses credit for closing costs
- Reduces out-of-pocket cash needed
- Repairs done post-closing at buyer's pace
- No closing delays

Price Reduction:
- Reduces loan amount (less money to buyer)
- Doesn't help with closing costs
- Buyer still needs cash for closing
- Less beneficial to cash-strapped buyers
```

## Maximum Concession Strategies

### Using Full 6% (FHA Example)

**$400,000 FHA Purchase:**

**Buyer's Actual Costs:**
- Closing Costs: $10,000
- Prepaid Taxes/Insurance: $3,000
- Escrow Reserves: $2,000
- **Total: $15,000**

**Maximum Concession:**
- 6% of $400,000 = $24,000
- **Unused Concession Capacity: $9,000**

**Creative Uses for Extra Concession:**

**Option 1: Discount Points (Rate Buydown)**
```
Use $5,000 to buy down rate from 7% to 6.5%
Saves buyer $167/month × 360 months = $60,000 lifetime
Seller's cost: $5,000 (absorbed in sale price)
```

**Option 2: Property Improvements**
```
Use $5,000 for new appliances
Or carpet allowance
Or painting credit
(Must be approved by lender and within guidelines)
```

**Option 3: Prepay More Reserves**
```
Build larger escrow reserves
Reduces buyer's monthly payment initially
Provides cushion for buyer
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Exceeding Maximum Limits

**Problem:**
```
$400,000 Conventional, 5% down
Max Concession: 3% = $12,000
Negotiated Concession: $15,000

Result: Lender DENIES excess $3,000
Deal requires renegotiation
Delays closing or kills deal
```

**Fix:**
Know the limits BEFORE negotiating concessions

### Mistake #2: Concession Without Price Support

**Problem:**
```
Original Price: $400,000
Add Concession: $15,000
New Price: $415,000
Appraisal: $405,000

Gap: $10,000
Lender won't lend on over-appraised amount
```

**Fix:**
Ensure price increase is supported by comparable sales

### Mistake #3: "Repair Allowance" Language

**Problem:**
```
Contract: "Seller provides $5,000 repair allowance"

Lender sees this as buyer getting cash for repairs
May not allow this structure
Creates confusion and delays
```

**Fix:**
Always use "seller credit toward buyer's closing costs"

### Mistake #4: Not Using Available Concession

**Problem:**
```
FHA buyer, $400,000 purchase
Buyer needs $12,000 for closing
Seller agrees to $12,000 concession

But max is $24,000 (6%)!
Unused $12,000 could buy down rate, add improvements
```

**Fix:**
Maximize concession to buyer's benefit when seller is willing

## Agent Best Practices

### At Offer Stage

**1. Calculate Buyer's Total Cash Need:**
```
Down Payment: $______
Closing Costs: $______
Prepaids/Reserves: $______
Repairs (if known): $______
TOTAL: $______
```

**2. Determine Concession Strategy:**
- How much does buyer need?
- What's the max allowed for loan type?
- How to structure offer price + concession?

**3. Present to Seller Properly:**
- Show net proceeds are same
- Explain how it helps deal close
- Frame as win-win

### During Negotiations

**1. After Inspection:**
- Get repair estimates quickly
- Negotiate as credit, not repairs
- Structure within concession limits

**2. If Appraisal Issues:**
- Adjust price and concession together
- Maintain seller's net proceeds
- Keep deal alive

### At Closing

**1. Verify Concession on Closing Disclosure:**
- Correct amount credited
- Applied to right items
- Within maximum limits

**2. Ensure Smooth Closing:**
- All parties understand concession structure
- No surprises at closing table
- Deal closes successfully

## Key Takeaways

### Concession Limits by Loan Type
- **FHA: 6%** (most generous)
- **VA: 4%** (very strong for 0% down buyers)
- **Conventional: 3-6%** (depends on down payment and occupancy)

### Always Use Credits, Not Repairs
- Negotiate repairs as "seller credit toward closing costs"
- Avoid "seller will repair" language
- No delays, disputes, or quality issues

### Price + Concession = Net Proceeds
- Seller's net is what matters
- Raising price to provide concession maintains seller's net
- Helps buyer with immediate cash needs

### Maximize Concessions When Possible
- Use extra concession for rate buydowns
- Don't leave money on the table
- Within limits, maximize buyer benefit

### Appraisal Must Support Price
- Can't inflate price beyond supportable value
- Provide strong comps to appraiser
- Have backup plan if appraisal low

### FHA/VA Buyers Benefit Most
- FHA: 6% max on 3.5% down (very powerful)
- VA: 4% max on 0% down (minimal cash needed)
- Concessions make these buyers very strong

---

**Bottom Line:** Seller's concessions are powerful deal-closing tools that benefit both parties when structured properly. Understanding concession limits, using credits instead of repair agreements, and strategically raising prices to provide larger concessions helps agents close more deals and serve cash-strapped buyers effectively. Always frame concessions to sellers as maintaining net proceeds while ensuring successful closings.

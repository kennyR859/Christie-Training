## Overview

Bridge loans allow homeowners to access equity from their current home before selling, enabling them to compete with cash offers and buy their next home without contingencies.

---

## What Are Bridge Loans?

**Purpose:** Access home equity for down payment on new purchase before selling current home

**How It Works:**
```
Current Home:
- Value: $700,000
- Mortgage: $300,000
- Equity: $400,000

Bridge Loan:
- Unity lends against $400,000 equity
- Customer uses for down payment on new home
- Current home STAYS ON MARKET
- Qualifies for BOTH mortgages
- Bridge loan is interest-only
```

## Agent Talking Points

**For Hesitant Customers:**
> "Bridge loans let you compete with cash buyers without the sale contingency that sellers hate. Statistics show homes in our market sell within 60 days. You're only carrying both mortgages temporarily, and the bridge loan is interest-only so payments are manageable. If it's the right house, don't lose it waiting to sell first."

**Cost Analysis:**
```
Scenario: Carry both mortgages 60 days

Current Home Payment: $3,000/month
New Home Payment: $4,000/month
Bridge Loan (Interest-Only): $1,500/month
Total 2 Months: $17,000

Alternative: Lost dream home, settled for less desirable property
Value: Priceless
```

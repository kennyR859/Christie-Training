# Day 12 - Topic 03: Conventional Loans (Fannie Mae Guidelines)

**Topic Number:** Day12_03
**Category:** Mortgage Products - Core Lending
**Instructor:** Pat Grande - Unity Bank/Unity Mortgage
**Importance Level:** CRITICAL - Most common loan type

## 📋 Overview

Conventional loans, also known as Fannie Mae loans, are the gold standard of residential mortgages. They offer the best rates, lowest fees, and most flexible terms for qualified borrowers. Every agent should understand conventional loan guidelines to properly qualify buyers and set expectations.

**Key Point:** Pat always tries to get customers into conventional loans first because they're the best option for most buyers.

## 🏆 What Are Conventional Loans?

### Definition

**Conventional Loan = Fannie Mae Loan**

These are mortgages that meet Fannie Mae's standardized underwriting guidelines. Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) that purchases mortgages from lenders, providing liquidity to the mortgage market.

**Why Called "Conventional":**
- They follow conventional (standard) underwriting guidelines
- Not government-insured (unlike FHA or VA loans)
- Most common type of mortgage in the market
- Industry standard for qualified borrowers

### Why They're the Best

**Pat's Philosophy:**
> "These loans are the best loans kind of right for credit wise rate wise less fees less PMI and all that stuff"

**Advantages:**
1. **Lowest Interest Rates** - Better than FHA, portfolio, or hard money
2. **Lowest Fees** - Standard closing costs, no government insurance premiums
3. **Lowest PMI** - Private Mortgage Insurance cheaper than FHA's MIP
4. **PMI Removable** - After 2 years at 20% equity, PMI can be removed without refinancing
5. **Flexible Terms** - 15, 20, 30-year fixed or ARM options
6. **Investment Property Option** - Can use for rentals (FHA cannot)

## ✅ Qualifying Requirements

### Credit Score Requirements

**Fannie Mae Minimums:**
| Down Payment | Minimum Credit Score | Pat's Recommendation |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 3% down | 720 | Only with excellent profile |
| 5% down | 680 | Good option |
| 10% down | 680 | Standard |
| 15% down | 680 | Standard |
| 20%+ down | 680 | No PMI threshold |

**Pat's Guidance:**
- Fannie Mae allows 620 minimum
- But PMI will be extremely high with 620-679 score
- Pat recommends 680 minimum for reasonable PMI rates
- 720+ gets best PMI rates

### Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio

**Maximum DTI: 50%**

**How DTI Is Calculated:**
```
Proposed Monthly Mortgage Payment:    $3,000
+ Current Monthly Debts:              $1,500
  (car loans, student loans, credit cards)
= Total Monthly Debt:                 $4,500

÷ Gross Monthly Income:               $9,000

= DTI Ratio:                          50%

Result: ✅ Qualifies (at maximum)
If over 50%: ❌ Cannot go conventional (try FHA at 55%)
```

**What's Included in DTI:**
- Proposed mortgage payment (principal + interest + taxes + insurance + HOA)
- Car loans
- Student loans
- Credit card minimum payments
- Personal loans
- Child support / alimony
- Other mortgage payments (if keeping other properties)

**What's NOT Included:**
- Utilities
- Cell phone
- Insurance (except home/auto if financed)
- Groceries
- Entertainment

### Income Verification

**Must "Fit the Box":**
Conventional loans require structured income verification. You either qualify or you don't - there's no gray area.

**W2 Employees:**
- Last 2 years W2s
- 1 month most recent pay stubs
- Employer verification (phone call or written)
- 2 years personal tax returns

**Commission-Based:**
- Base salary identified
- Average commission over last 2 years
- Must show consistent commission income
- If commission declining, may not count full amount

**Self-Employed:**
- 2 years business tax returns
- 2 years personal tax returns
- Income = Net income after expenses
- Can add back depreciation (non-cash expense)
- Business must show 2-year history

**Example - Self-Employed Challenge:**
```
Business Tax Return Shows:
Gross Revenue: $500,000
Operating Expenses: -$350,000
Depreciation: -$50,000
Net Income: $100,000

Conventional Calculation:
Net Income: $100,000
+ Add Back Depreciation: $50,000
Qualifying Income: $150,000 ÷ 12 = $12,500/month

If they wrote off too much:
Net Income: $50,000
+ Depreciation: $20,000
Qualifying Income: $70,000 ÷ 12 = $5,833/month
(May not qualify for desired loan amount)
```

## 💰 Down Payment Requirements

### Owner-Occupied Properties

| Property Type | Minimum Down | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **1 Family** | 3% | Requires 720 credit score |
| **1 Family** | 5% | Standard minimum (680 credit) |
| **2 Family** | 5% | Can use 75% future rental income |
| **3-4 Family** | 20% | Higher risk, more down required |

### Investment Properties

| Property Type | Minimum Down | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **1 Family** | 20% | Cannot use 3-5% down for investment |
| **2-4 Family** | 25% | Can use 75% rental income to qualify |

**Important Distinction:**
- **Owner-Occupied:** You will live there as primary residence
- **Investment:** You will rent it to tenants (or it's a second home)

### Market Reality Check

**What Fannie Mae Allows vs What Wins Offers:**

```
Fannie Mae Allows:
- 3% down (720 credit)
- 5% down (680 credit)

Market Reality (Multiple Offers):
- 20% down offers win
- Sellers prefer larger down payments
- More down payment = more serious buyer
- Less financing risk for seller
```

**Pat's Advice:**
While 3-5% down is possible, in competitive markets since COVID, offers with 20%+ down payment are significantly more likely to be accepted.

## 🏠 Property Requirements

### The Property Must Also Qualify

It's not just about the borrower - the property must meet Fannie Mae guidelines too.

**Property Condition Standards:**
- Structurally sound
- Habitable and safe
- No significant deferred maintenance
- Major systems functional (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roof)
- Free of health/safety hazards

**Property Type Restrictions:**

**✅ Acceptable:**
- Single-family homes
- 2-4 family homes
- Condos (if Fannie Mae approved OR questionnaire completed)
- Townhomes
- PUDs (Planned Unit Developments)
- Manufactured homes (if on permanent foundation)

**❌ Not Acceptable (without special programs):**
- Properties with major structural issues
- Homes without heat or functional systems
- Properties with environmental hazards
- Co-ops (very difficult, special lenders only)
- Properties in flood zones (without flood insurance)

### Condo Requirements

**Post-Miami Collapse (2025):**
- Very few condos are Fannie Mae approved anymore
- Management must complete detailed questionnaire including engineering certification
- Many management companies refuse due to liability concerns
- If not approved = Must use portfolio loan (20% down, higher rate)

**Check Before Making Offer:**
Give condo development name to Pat → His processor checks Fannie Mae approval status → Know before customer falls in love with unit

## 📊 Conventional Loan Examples

### Example 1: First-Time Buyer (Ideal Scenario)

```
Buyer Profile:
- Credit Score: 720
- Income: $90,000/year ($7,500/month)
- Debts: $500/month (car loan)
- Down Payment Saved: $25,000
- Looking at: $400,000 single-family home

Analysis:
Down Payment: 5% = $20,000
Loan Amount: $380,000
Payment (6% rate): ~$2,280/month
+ Taxes/Insurance: ~$800/month
+ PMI: ~$250/month
Total Monthly: $3,330

DTI Calculation:
$3,330 (housing) + $500 (car) = $3,830 total debt
$3,830 ÷ $7,500 income = 51% DTI

Result: ❌ Slightly over 50% max
Solutions:
- Pay off car loan ($500/month) → DTI drops to 44% ✅
- Lower purchase price to $375,000 → DTI drops to 49% ✅
- Wait for rate drop to 5.5% → Payment lower, DTI 48% ✅
```

### Example 2: Investor Buying Rental

```
Buyer Profile:
- Credit Score: 740
- Income: $120,000/year ($10,000/month)
- Current Debts: $1,000/month
- Down Payment: $120,000 (20%)
- Looking at: $500,000 two-family rental

Analysis:
Down Payment: 25% = $125,000 (investor requirement)
Loan Amount: $375,000
Payment (6.5% rate): ~$2,370/month
+ Taxes/Insurance: ~$1,000/month
Total Monthly: $3,370

BUT... can use rental income:
Expected Rent: $2,500/month per unit = $5,000 total
Fannie Mae allows: 75% of $5,000 = $3,750/month credit

DTI Calculation:
$3,370 (housing) + $1,000 (debts) - $3,750 (rental income) = $620 net
$620 ÷ $10,000 = 6.2% DTI

Result: ✅ Easily qualifies!
```

### Example 3: Move-Up Buyer Keeping First Home

```
Buyer Profile:
- Credit Score: 710
- Income: $150,000/year ($12,500/month)
- Current Home: $2,500/month mortgage (keeping as rental)
- Other Debts: $800/month
- Down Payment: $100,000
- New Home: $600,000

Analysis:
New Loan: $500,000 at 6%
New Payment: ~$3,000/month
+ Taxes/Insurance: ~$1,200/month
New Home Total: $4,200/month

Can use 75% rental income on current home:
Expected Rent: $3,200/month
75% Credit: $2,400/month

DTI Calculation:
$4,200 (new) + $2,500 (current) + $800 (debts) - $2,400 (rental) = $5,100
$5,100 ÷ $12,500 = 40.8% DTI

Result: ✅ Qualifies comfortably
```

## 🔄 PMI Removal Strategy

### How PMI Works on Conventional Loans

**When PMI Required:**
- Any loan with less than 20% down payment
- Cost: $150-$400/month typically (varies by credit score, down payment, property type)

**How PMI Calculated (Current System):**
Based on 3 factors:
1. Down payment percentage
2. Property type
3. Credit score (NEW - post-2015)

**Higher credit score = Lower PMI**

### Removing PMI After 2 Years

**Option 1: Automatic Removal at 20% Equity**

**How It Works:**
```
Year 0: Purchase $500K home, 10% down ($50K)
        Loan: $450K, PMI: $280/month

Year 2: Home appreciates 5%/year = $552K value
        Principal paid down: ~$15K
        New loan balance: $435K
        Equity: $552K - $435K = $117K (21.2%)

Action: Call mortgage servicer
        Request PMI removal
        Servicer orders drive-by or BPO
        If 20%+ equity confirmed → PMI removed

Result: Save $280/month, NO REFINANCE needed
```

**Requirements:**
- At least 2 years since loan origination
- No late payments in last 12 months
- Property must appraise at value showing 20%+ equity

**Option 2: Refinance Anytime**

If rates drop 1%+ or you want to remove PMI sooner:
- Refinance to new loan
- New appraisal (if shows 20%+ equity, no PMI on new loan)
- Must weigh closing costs vs PMI savings

### The COVID Exception

**Special Case:**
Borrowers with 2.375% - 3.5% COVID-era rates will NEVER refinance just to remove PMI:
- Rate too good to give up
- Small PMI payment worth keeping ultra-low rate
- Will just pay PMI until natural paydown reaches 20%

## ⚖️ Conventional vs FHA vs Portfolio

### Quick Comparison

| Feature | Conventional | FHA | Portfolio (Unity) |
|---------|-------------|-----|------------------|
| **Min Down** | 3-5% | 3.5% | 20-25% |
| **Credit Min** | 680 (realistically) | 620 | 680-700 |
| **DTI Max** | 50% | 55% | Up to 200%* |
| **PMI/MIP** | PMI (removable) | MIP (lifetime) | None at 20%+ |
| **Best For** | Good credit, stable income | Lower credit, minimal down | Self-employed, high DTI |
| **Rates** | Best | Slightly higher | 0.5-1% higher |
| **Investment OK** | Yes | No | Yes |

*With strong compensating factors

### When to Use Conventional

**✅ Use Conventional When:**
- Credit score 680+
- Stable W2 income or 2+ years self-employment
- DTI under 50%
- Down payment 5-20%+
- Property meets Fannie Mae guidelines
- Customer wants best rate and lowest fees

**❌ Don't Use Conventional When:**
- Credit score under 680 (FHA likely better)
- DTI over 50% (try FHA 55% or portfolio)
- Self-employed with lots of write-offs (portfolio may work better)
- Only 3.5% down + credit under 720 (FHA likely better)
- Property doesn't meet Fannie Mae standards

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways for Agents

### Pre-Qualifying Customers

**Questions to Ask:**
1. "What's your credit score?" (Need 680+ for conventional)
2. "How much do you have for down payment?" (5-20%+)
3. "Are you W2 employee or self-employed?" (Income verification type)
4. "What monthly debts do you have?" (Calculate DTI)
5. "Looking at owner-occupied or investment?" (Down payment requirements differ)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Mistake #1:** Telling customer with 620 credit they can do conventional with 3% down
- **Reality:** Need 720 credit for 3% down, and PMI will be very high

**❌ Mistake #2:** Not calculating DTI before showing $500K homes
- **Reality:** Customer with $8K/month income probably can't afford $500K

**❌ Mistake #3:** Assuming self-employed customer making "$200K" qualifies
- **Reality:** Tax returns may show $80K after write-offs

**❌ Mistake #4:** Not checking if condo is Fannie Mae approved
- **Reality:** Most aren't post-Miami, will need portfolio loan (20% down)

### When to Call Pat

**Call Pat When:**
- Customer claims to be pre-approved but seems borderline
- Self-employed customer (income verification complex)
- Customer looking at 2-4 family properties
- Condo purchase (need to check approval status)

- ANY questions about qualification

**Pat Will:**
- Ask detailed qualifying questions

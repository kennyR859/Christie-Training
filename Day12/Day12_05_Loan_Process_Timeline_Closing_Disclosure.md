### Phase 4: Title Work

**Timeline: Days 1-21 (Parallel Process)**

**🚨 CRITICAL: Order Regency Title on DAY 1**

**Why Order Immediately:**
- Takes 2-3 weeks for complete title search
- Early discovery of issues = time to resolve
- Don't wait for attorney review to complete
- **Regency doesn't charge if deal cancels**

**What Title Company Does:**
1. Searches property records
2. Identifies any liens, judgments, or encumbrances
3. Confirms clear ownership chain
4. Issues title commitment
5. Prepares title insurance

**Potential Issues Found:**
- Second mortgages not discharged
- Judgment liens
- Tax liens
- Boundary disputes
- Easement issues

**Example Problem:**
> Pat had case where second mortgage from 2010 wasn't discharged. Had to go to court. Discovery in Week 1 = resolved by closing. Discovery in Week 6 = delayed closing 3 weeks.

---

### Phase 5: Appraisal

**Timeline: 7-14 Days**

**Process:**
1. Ordered after attorney review (Day 3-5)
2. Appraiser contacts listing agent to schedule
3. Appraiser inspects property (1-2 hours)

**Unity Advantage:**

---

### Phase 8: Closing Disclosure (CD)

**Timeline: Minimum 3 Days Before Closing**

**🚨 FEDERAL LAW: CD Must Be Issued 3 Days Before Closing**

**What Is the CD:**
Legal document showing:
- Final loan amount
- Interest rate
- Monthly payment (principal + interest)
- Escrows (taxes and insurance held monthly)
- All closing costs itemized
- Cash to close (total amount buyer brings)
- Seller credits and concessions

**3-Day Rule:**
```
Example Timeline:
Monday 9am: CD issued to customer
Monday 9am: Customer must sign CD
Thursday: Earliest possible closing day

Cannot close Tuesday or Wednesday - must wait 3 full business days
```

**Why 3 Days Required:**
- Federal consumer protection law
- Gives buyer time to review all costs
- Prevents last-minute rate/fee changes
- Prevents predatory lending practices

**If Anything Changes:**
Must issue new CD and restart 3-day clock. Changes include:
- Interest rate change
- Loan amount change
- Fee increases
- APR change over 0.125%

---

### Phase 9: Final Steps

**Timeline: Days 28-30**

**1 Week Before Closing:**
**🚨 AGENT MUST REQUEST COMMISSION STATEMENT**

**Commission Statement Process:**
```
Agent Actions:
Day 23: Request commission statement from Admin (Platform/Zip Forms/My SarcyG)
Day 24-25: Receive commission statement
Day 25: Email to:
  - Regency Title
  - Buyer's attorney
  - Seller's attorney
  - Pat/Alexandra (CC)

Day 27: Verify title company received it
Day 28: CD issued (includes agent commissions)
```

**🚨 CRITICAL:** Without commission statement 3 days before closing, CD cannot be issued, closing cannot happen.

**Other Final Steps:**

## ⚠️ Common Delays and How to Prevent

### Delay #1: Missing Commission Statement

**Problem:** Agent forgets to request commission statement

**Impact:** CD cannot be issued, closing delayed

**Prevention:**
- Set calendar reminder 1 week before closing
- Request from Admin immediately
- Follow up to ensure sent to title company
- Verify title company received it 3 days before closing

### Delay #2: Customer Opens New Credit

**Problem:** Customer buys furniture or car during process

**Impact:** DTI increases, may no longer qualify

**Prevention:**
- Pat warns customers during pre-approval
- Agent reinforces: "NO new credit until after closing"
- Tell customers upfront this can kill the deal

**Pat's Instructions:**
> "Do not buy furniture Do not buy a car do not put extra money on your credit cards do not close your credit cards"

### Delay #3: Large Deposits

**Problem:** Customer deposits $20,000 cash into bank account

**Impact:** Must source and document (cannot use cash)

**Prevention:**
- Warn customers: NO large deposits during process
- If unavoidable, document BEFORE depositing
- Gift money: Keep in parent's account until instructed

### Delay #4: Job Change

**Problem:** Customer changes jobs during process

**Impact:** Must re-verify employment, may delay or kill deal

**Prevention:**
- Tell customers: Stay at current job until after closing
- If unavoidable, same industry/same salary = usually okay
- Different industry or lower salary = major problem

### Delay #5: Rate Lock Expires

**Problem:** Process takes longer than rate lock period

**Impact:** Rate may increase if market rates went up

**Prevention:**
- Lock rate for appropriate period (45-60 days typical)
- Unity doesn't charge to extend lock
- But new rate may be higher if market moved

## What Are "Junk Fees"?

### Legitimate vs Junk Fees

**Legitimate Fees (Unavoidable):**
- ✅ Appraisal fee (~$500-700)
- ✅ Title insurance (varies by property value)
- ✅ Title search and attorney fees
- ✅ Recording fees (county/state)
- ✅ Property taxes and insurance escrow
- ✅ Credit report fee ($30-50)

**Junk Fees (Questionable/Excessive):**
- ❌ "Processing fee" ($500-1,500)
- ❌ "Underwriting fee" ($800-1,200)
- ❌ "Administrative fee" ($300-700)
- ❌ "Document preparation fee" ($200-500)
- ❌ "Funding fee" ($500-1,000)
- ❌ "Courier fee" ($50-150)
- ❌ "Email/fax fee" ($75-200)

**Pat's Definition:**
> "Junk fees are made-up charges that cover the lender's operating costs but are passed on to the customer. If I'm paying my staff anyway, why should the customer pay an 'underwriting fee'? That's my cost of doing business, not theirs."

## Unity's "Clean Loan" Philosophy

### No Junk Fees Policy

**Unity Bank Approach:**
- ✅ No processing fees
- ✅ No underwriting fees
- ✅ No administrative fees
- ✅ No document prep fees
- ✅ Transparent, itemized costs only

**What Unity DOES Charge:**
- Actual third-party costs (appraisal, title, recording)
- Points if applicable (portfolio loans, construction loans)
- Standard origination fee IF competitive situation requires it
- That's it.

**Savings Example:**
```
Typical Big Bank:
Appraisal: $650
Title Insurance: $2,500
Recording Fees: $400
Processing Fee: $895
Underwriting Fee: $995
Admin Fee: $495
Doc Prep Fee: $350
Total Lender Fees: $2,735 (junk fees)

Unity Bank:
Appraisal: $650
Title Insurance: $2,500
Recording Fees: $400
Processing Fee: $0
Underwriting Fee: $0
Admin Fee: $0
Doc Prep Fee: $0
Total Lender Fees: $0

Customer Saves: $2,735
```

## The Rate vs Fees Trade-Off

### Understanding APR vs Interest Rate

**Interest Rate:**
- The actual percentage charged on loan principal
- What you see advertised
- Determines monthly payment

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate):**
- Includes interest rate PLUS all fees
- Shows true cost of loan
- Better comparison metric
- **ALWAYS compare APR, not just interest rate**

**Example:**
```
Lender A:
Interest Rate: 6.5%
Fees: $500
APR: 6.55%

Lender B:
Interest Rate: 6.25%
Fees: $8,500
APR: 6.75%

Lender A is CHEAPER despite higher interest rate!
```

### Points and Rate Buydowns

**What Is a Point?**
- 1 point = 1% of loan amount
- Used to "buy down" interest rate
- Permanent rate reduction

**When Points Make Sense:**
```
$500,000 Loan:

Option 1: 7% rate, 0 points
Monthly payment: $3,327
Total paid Year 1: $39,924

Option 2: 6.5% rate, 1 point ($5,000)
Monthly payment: $3,160
Total paid Year 1: $42,920 ($37,920 + $5,000 point)

Break-even: Month 30 (2.5 years)

If staying 3+ years: Buy the point
If selling in 2 years: Don't buy the point
```

**Pat's Guidance:**
> "Points can save money long-term, but only if you're keeping the loan 3+ years. If you might refinance or sell soon, points are wasted money."

## How to Compare Lender Estimates

### The Loan Estimate Form

**Federal Law (TRID):**
- All lenders MUST use same Loan Estimate form
- Issued within 3 days of application
- Shows all costs in standardized format
- Easy comparison between lenders

**Key Sections to Compare:**

**Section A - Origination Charges:**
```
Lender A: $2,500 (fees + points)
Lender B: $0
Lender C: $4,800

Unity: Typically $0-1,000 (points only if portfolio/construction)
```

**Section B - Services You Cannot Shop For:**
```
Appraisal, credit report, flood cert
Should be similar across lenders ($600-800 total)
```

**Section C - Services You Can Shop For:**
```
Title insurance, survey, pest inspection
Can choose your own providers
Unity uses Regency Title (agent benefits)
```

**Section E - Taxes and Government Fees:**
```
Recording fees, transfer taxes
Same regardless of lender
```

**Section F - Prepaids:**
```
Property taxes, insurance, interest
Same regardless of lender
```

**Section G - Initial Escrow:**
```
Reserves for taxes and insurance
Same regardless of lender
```

**Total Cash to Close:**
Add all sections = what buyer needs at closing

## Red Flags in Lender Estimates

### Warning Signs of Predatory Lending

**🚨 Red Flag #1: Excessive Origination Fees**
```
$500,000 loan with $5,000+ in origination charges

Example breakdown:
Origination fee: 1% = $5,000
Processing fee: $1,200
Underwriting fee: $1,000
Admin fee: $500
Total: $7,700 (1.54% of loan!)

Unity: $0 - $1,000 (0-0.2% of loan)
```

**🚨 Red Flag #2: "Discount Points" That Don't Discount**
```
Lender charges 1 point ($5,000)
But rate is HIGHER than competitor with no points

This is a junk fee disguised as "discount points"
Real discount points LOWER your rate
```

**🚨 Red Flag #3: Bait-and-Switch Rates**
```
Advertised: 6.0% rate
Loan Estimate: 6.5% rate
"Oh, that's for perfect credit only"
"Your rate is higher due to [made-up reason]"

Unity: Honest quotes from day one
```

**🚨 Red Flag #4: Unclear or Vague Fees**
```
"Miscellaneous fees: $1,500"
"Administrative costs: $800"
"Processing and handling: $1,200"

What ARE these?
Unity: Every fee clearly labeled and justified
```

**🚨 Red Flag #5: High APR Despite Low Rate**
```
Rate: 6.25% (looks great!)
APR: 7.1% (fees are astronomical!)

Always look at APR to see true cost
```

## Online Lenders vs Local Banks

### The Online Lender Trap

**How They Advertise:**
- Lowest rates you'll see
- "Fast approval in minutes!"
- "No fees, ever!"
- Slick websites, easy applications

**The Reality:**
```
Advertised Rate: 5.75% (amazing!)
Your Rate After Application: 6.5% (not so amazing)
Fees Added: $6,500 in junk fees
Closing Timeline: 60-90 days (delays and problems)
Customer Service: Offshore call center, different person every time
Problem Solving: "Not my department"
```

**Pat's Warning:**
> "Online lenders advertise rates they'll never actually give you. They make money on volume and fees. When problems arise, good luck getting help. You're just a number in their system."

### Unity Bank vs Online Lenders

**Unity Advantages:**
```
Consistent Contact:
Unity: Pat Grande (one person, every time)
Online: Different rep every phone call

Problem Solving:
Unity: Pat can call CEO, fix issues same day
Online: "Submit ticket, wait 3-5 business days"

Timeline:
Unity: 30-45 days to close
Online: 60-90 days, often delayed

Fees:
Unity: Minimal, transparent
Online: Advertised low, actual high

Flexibility:
Unity: Portfolio loans, creative solutions
Online: Rigid guidelines, no exceptions

After Closing:
Unity: Pat available for questions forever
Online: "Thank you, goodbye"
```

**When Online Might Work:**
- Perfect credit (760+)
- W2 income, straightforward situation
- No timeline pressure
- Willing to deal with impersonal service
- Lots of cash reserves

**When Unity Is Better:**
- Want personal service and problem-solving
- Complex financial situation
- Fast closing needed
- Value relationship and local presence
- Might need portfolio loan or flexibility

## How to Help Customers Compare

### Agent's Role

**Step 1: Encourage Shopping**
> "You should absolutely talk to 2-3 lenders to compare. Here's what to look for: compare APR, not just rate, look at total fees in Section A, and ask about timeline and problem-solving. I recommend starting with Pat at Unity because of their transparency and service, but you should verify that yourself."

**Step 2: Educate on What to Compare**
- ✅ APR (not just interest rate)
- ✅ Total Section A fees (origination charges)
- ✅ Closing timeline capability
- ✅ Personal service and accessibility
- ✅ Problem-solving ability (portfolio loans, etc.)

**Step 3: Review Loan Estimates Together**
```
Sit with customer, compare side-by-side:

"Okay, let's look at Section A - origination charges.
Lender A: $4,500
Unity: $0
That's a $4,500 savings right there.

Now APR:
Lender A: 6.8%
Unity: 6.5%
Unity's true cost is lower.

Timeline:
Lender A: 60 days
Unity: 30 days
Unity closes twice as fast."
```

**Step 4: Value Beyond Rate**
> "The cheapest rate doesn't always mean the cheapest loan. Unity's value is in problem-solving - portfolio loans, fast closings, under-appraisal solutions, personal service. When problems arise, Pat can fix them. Can an online lender do that?"

---

## Common Customer Objections

### "But this online lender has a lower rate!"

**Agent Response:**
> "Great! Let's look at the full Loan Estimate they provided. What's the APR? What are the Section A fees? And importantly, what's the timeline and what happens if problems come up? Sometimes a slightly higher rate with zero fees is actually cheaper, plus you get personal service and problem-solving ability. Let's compare apples to apples."

### "My friend got 5.5% from [online lender]"

**Agent Response:**
> "Rates change daily based on credit score, down payment, loan type, and property. Your friend's situation might be different. Also, what was advertised vs what they actually got might be different. Let's get YOU a real quote based on YOUR situation from Pat, and then you can compare real numbers, not hypothetical ones."

### "Why should I pay more for the same loan?"

**Agent Response:**
> "It's not the same loan. Unity offers portfolio options, under-appraisal solutions, fast closings, and personal service that online lenders can't match. When your appraisal comes in low or you have a complex situation, Pat can save your deal. Online lenders will just deny you. The question is: what's that worth to you?"

## Industry Problems Pat Calls Out

### Junk Fee Epidemic

**Pat's Frustration:**
> "I see Loan Estimates with $5,000-8,000 in made-up fees. Processing fee, underwriting fee, admin fee, document fee, funding fee, wire fee. These are my costs of doing business! Why am I charging customers for my own operating expenses? It's wrong."

### Bait-and-Switch Tactics

**Common Practice:**
1. Advertise ultra-low rate to get customers
2. Customer applies
3. "Oh, that rate was for perfect credit only"
4. "Your rate is actually 1% higher"
5. Customer already invested time, stays anyway

**Unity's Approach:**
> "Pat quotes honest rates from day one. No surprises, no bait-and-switch. The rate he quotes is the rate you'll get (barring credit or property issues discovered later)."

### Lack of Service After Closing

**Industry Standard:**
- Loan closes, lender disappears
- Servicer takes over (different company)
- Customer has questions, no one to call

**Unity's Approach:**
- Pat available after closing
- Questions about loan? Call Pat.
- Refinance considerations? Call Pat.
- Relationship continues forever

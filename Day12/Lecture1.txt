So it's the biggest gimmick ever yeah biggest gimmick the one girl who's doing it is from from Gateway like it's no one is underwriting alone without a property I can guarantee you that it's a glorified pre approval that they're just pointing on a commitment you have a commitment you're approved and if you read it subject to AW 2 verifying W2 verifying a pay stub or most recent stuff because they haven't gotten it and so on i'm just saying out loud people want to believe it they believe it but it's yeah let people know that you guys have to know what the underwriter does I mean it's pretty thorough it's really very thorough so they have to verify their income which means they have to call the company or the company has to send a document right that they work for they wouldn't see their income tax report and tax income tax returns for what two years two years yeah personally they want to see their pay stubs how many 1 month 1 month There's a whole bunch of things they can't just do it over the phone Yeah exactly no one does like I'll ask for a tax return if you tell me hey I'm self employed how much do you make a year eight out of 10 times that customer gives me the gross amount instead of the net so that's why I always ask for the business tax returns if they're self employed just to be sure But you know but if they're putting 2025% down because My Portfolio I didn't work around it but no one's doing it like it's just too much work it takes hours to underwrite a loan to make sure the pace of it's right the W twos are right the income tax are right they got to follow DU and they're not going to put it down and you don't even know how much OK they can Max you out say it's 600 but how about the taxes or not 10G's what they told them were 20G's then they got to underwrite it again that's my point is no one's doing it it's just something that they're putting out there to get more business because someone called them on like me saying hey how much you make a year is it AW 2 is it a pace of do you have pay stubs and W twos at this or are you self employed and it's just a glorified pre-approval and people are believing it Realtors who've been in the business forever are believing it is that right Well I'll tell you about people believe things they see advertisements in paper and whatnot I don't know if I told you guys this but years ago when my husband was alive he would say he looked at the Ridgewood news and he saw and I can't remember her name and this girl had just started at Caldwell I was at Caldwell Banker at the time and she just started nice scalp she lived in town we lived in town and she put this ad in the Town journal Saddle River Saddle River Expert no not expert saddle Saddle River Specialist or something like that she put in nice to add her picture Saddle Rivers but and she kept running it and running it and my husband turned and he said I thought you were the Saddle River specialist it was like he believed it So people believe what they see that's what marketing is all about that's why you have to give a good game plan in your marketing and a good you know value proposition because people will believe it Well you're exactly right so it's crazy It's really funny I'm trying to think of other things that that I saw in the newspaper where oh top real estate agent what does that mean when they're not you know but people believe it you know so does that mean you know top does that mean they make the most money they have the most deals you know so they can take statistics and and how you doing Yeah listen you know you got to fill it out you got to build relationships i'm here for a reason because you close deals and we try to get things done as much as possible and we're pretty good to get them and but nowadays like I keep telling everybody you're fighting for the everyone's fighting for the same pieces to a customer and customers are naive right just like when they get hey why is your interest rate 6 i'm making up numbers 6 and 1/2 and I just called Rocket Mortgage and they told me they're 5 and 3/4 I go well did you look at your loan estimate because rates change every day I could be 1/4 off I could be 1/4 more or less depending on when you call me sometimes they change 34 times a day So if you're telling me you called me in a 6 1/2 and then you called Vernon at 6 1/4 maybe that changed 'cause they do change sometimes two three times a day but if I'm saying 6 1/2 and someone says 5 3/4 and you call 2 other banks and you're at the same number the question is how many points you pay because the customer doesn't realize all they're fixated is on the rate and in today's market no customer should be paying any points on the traditional loan unless they need it to buy down the rate to qualify for the mortgage but if they don't because they're going to refine 18 to 24 months anyway I tell everybody at 16 18 24 months they're going to refi again and the point is one percent of your loan amount the average loan amount up here is 600 to 800,000 that's that's a 700,000 that's 7000 dollars extra in closing fees if you break it down on a monthly basis compared to say 24 months you're never going to make it up it's usually four four and a half years in and it's a waste of money and time Yes yes yeah and I think they will and they have they do everything for me depending on the day right depending on the time right so they are trending down the housing market you know needs to get a little boost and it's not because I think it's in the rates by the rates going down the people refi during Covid or looking at downsize now feel more comfortable because they don't mind paying a 5 1/2 instead of 7 1/2 in a rate when it was a year ago I downsize it 5 1/2 you know even though I have 3 1/2 it's still 2% more but it's still the average has been 6 1/2 over 30 years I'll do it now and I think that's what's going to happen is going to be actually there was an article I read put out by I'm trying to think who it was but that rates right now what what's the rate right now today let's say I think it's like depending on the credit itself like 6 6 and 1/4 so actually it's the lowest it's been in in in the history of real estate if you take out that Covid Yeah Covid years and and I thought about it and I thought of course it's true because I remember when I first married we bought a house at and the interest rate was 7 through the years I used to wish I could have that 7 mortgage because you were paying 15 14 you know and back in the day and the market survived I agree so I think what why we have such a slow inventory right now is just what Pat said there were so many people that refinance during that time and they have a three or 2.75 mortgage yeah and they don't let it go now once it gets down to a reasonable amount and they want to size down and we'll see more homes coming on the market Yep and you said they don't want it they don't want to let it go and everybody who could refund during that time meaning credit wise equity wise income wise did who can do it for A traditional loan so all this is doing the last three years created another rebid rule that when the rates go down everyone's going to get busy because the numbers are based the economy numbers are based on mortgage numbers too right so at the end of the day you know no one was refunding anymore I got a 2.37 5 under 15 year mortgage i'm never going to replies OK unless I'm going to sell and then I'm going to buy something else and then whatever the going rate is in but to refi to leave my house know what I'll never do I'm never going to we're never going to see those rates again at least it's another end of the world it was a complete outlier just out of the blue I don't know what happened My phone didn't stop but it's like what really triggered it and second home still how many people did we have hey New York customers calling from all our agents here hey what are you doing well you know my son's only two We were planning on moving to Jersey that say whenever they start kindergarten or first grade for a better school system but because of Covid and we don't know what's going on we're going to come in earlier because I can't go in the elevator he can't go to the park he can't go get ice cream because nothing's open he could do nothing and that's what also boosted right how many people were moving here and how many people wanted houses in the beach down the beach or in the woods in Poconos I remember it was your office we had a Zoom meeting I don't remember who the agent was this one firm was running the office and the professor here was running in my life someone in Mahwah asked us anybody and it was in July I remember like it was yesterday does anybody have a house with a pool and like Alpine in that area I have a customer from New York who wants to rent it for the whole month of August and is willing to pay $30,000 Yes yes there was people were desperate to desperate out of this get out of the city that they can go on their own backyard they don't have to worry about the kids they can go in the pool yeah it's the first time that Helmswood Pools had a huge advantage because prior to that you know there were the country clubs there were the town pools there was you know lots of pools that you go to but now you couldn't and you couldn't the city was closed the city was closed and then they act Had a big advantage a friend of mine

-----------------------------------------------------------

Because of that the second when you were buying a hole down the shore or in the Poconos it would be the same rate as your primary to 2nd home but because so many people bought 2nd homes during Covid the Fannie Mae who runs all the mortgages the portfolio was getting heavy in second homes but they couldn't say no I we're not doing no more mortgages so they raised the rates on the 2nd homes still to this day the 2nd homes are a little bit higher than the primary because that's how many people bought 2nd homes and God forbid the market turns what do people let go 1st their investment property 2nd their 2nd home and then their home God forbid the market turns or you lose your job and stuff like that so they had to a little bit unattractive but it didn't stop people because they needed to get the hell out of the city and it still does a little bit like that because people don't know what the next 1's coming what are we going to do where are we going to go oh we'll be prepared this time I still hear from a handful of people once i'm like what are you doing they say yeah we're just doing it in case something happens again we want to have a yard with a pool in my mind like really and they're like yeah so it's true so anyway this is Pat Unity Mortgage he has saved our lives so many times

-------------------------------------------------------------

You can still have the concierge shoulders I call it now OK where it's very important in today's market right that our customers because it's getting a little more difficult feel special you're buying a house it's not like you're going to buy a car not that it's not important to buy a car but 300 400 500 600,000 that's a big investment right it's scary and you know you need someone who's going to hold their hand structured alone the right way Try not to take advantage of fees and points put them into the right program and banks usually do that right banks are I used to be on the mortgage broker side mortgage banker side where the more fees and the higher the rate I charged the more money I make here at the bank I get paid the same amount of money a percentage of the loan amount so it doesn't whether I charge 2.0 points one point and we don't charge points or charge extra fees because we just don't do that unless it's a specialty program where your client's going to know that up front OK so how is Pat Grande here at Christie's OK and oh by the way that's Alexandria alexandria wait sorry alexander is part of my team I have a whole team so she helps me with all my our Bergen County offices OK what 8 years for how long has Chris been open eight years Fern is managed running the Mahwah office one of the it's the first Christmas our our flagship office Sienna we opened so I knew a couple Realtors that went to work there they were sitting at the table like this during lunch one of the Realtors there goes hey you know I got a deal 20% down their mortgage company couldn't do it They started the process in June because the seller didn't want to leave because they had kids for high school our customer was cool OK no hurry they told him how to structure the deal because they were self employed the underwriter told them what to do from January when June came and they started the mortgage process that same underwriter who told them what to do said I can't do so the young the Realtors like Oh my gosh she told us this is a big deal yeah was a big deal was annoying at home 20% down They were they were upset they were going to get the mortgage it was so the straw one of the her name was Sharon and Fern said hey use Pat they got a special program portfolio which I go over and in two weeks we closed along and he couldn't believe it hence it got to Ilia downstairs and then a couple other deals were the same thing happened and that I came in we saved them hence we built the relationship and I've seen you grow from one to 30 officers I think I think other than what what you want to use Pat for and I'm telling you this because I want our customers to have the best service but he also is very creative and so if you have a customer that has an issue he went out of his way with this guy restructuring his the way he did his taxes basically you know restructuring the way he presented himself and and came up with a program for him that worked You know and that's sometimes you want to the customer won't want to go FHA and Pamela say hey wait a minute you might be better off going conventional you know and you save money you save peace so that's what I do and because we are a bank so you know we could you know we we have our own programs besides the standard programs God bless you got every other mortgage company or every other bank does So what every other bank does and every other mortgage company does and so do I which I like these loans too OK because they're a lot easier but I don't care loans alone they do conventional loans and FHA loans conventional loans right or the best loans kind of right for credit wise rate wise less fees less PMI and all that stuff OK so those are Fannie Mae loans they either fit the box or they don't which means it's the Italian in me so I'm very sorry OK which means in order to qualify for a conventional loan you need good credit which they say you can do it as little 620 I say 680 OK to start it the minimum because you get killed with the PMI if you're less than 680 everybody do what PMI is private mortgage insurance and for any loan that's under 20% less than 20% down that's right so I say 680 but when you do that you got to qualify for conventional loans Fannie Mae loans conventional same thing under the umbrella got to have good credit good income good down payment the property's got to fit the guidelines for Fannie Mae so if you buy a condo and it doesn't meet Fannie Mae guidelines to condo you can't go Fannie Mae even though you have all the rest of the good stuff so that's what I mean by property and I'll explain that a little bit later OK and you can only qualify what your pay stubs say like there's a the way we qualify people 50 debt to income ratio What does that mean when we take your current when we take the mortgage payment proposed mortgage payment plus your monthly debt which is like school loans car loans credit cards divided by your gross monthly income you got to be under 50% if you're over 50% can go conventional OK and those are the best I always try to put someone in a conventional loan because like I said they're the best rates and best programs When you when you do a conventional loan say you want to buy a one family owner occupied you can do it with as little as 3% down If you buy a two family you can do a 5% down now used to be 15 and then three and 4 you got to put 20 owner occupied if it's an investment property for one family you got to put 20% down and if it's a two to four family you got to put 25% down for investment properties write that down or get that in your brain I'll tell you because you are going to get you are going to be inundated once you start with people looking for two families and investment property and we have to know this and understand OK I'll explain this all to the customer we're just going over basics here that's my job not that you can't I'd rather you not yeah but II don't want to see an agent customer come to an agent and say well I only have 5% down but I want to buy a two family you know and then say oh I don't think you could do it you know they got it you got to know it you know so you can do it with as little as 5% down for two family on a conventional side but when they talk to me the goal is when you get a customer and you ask them have you been pre approved yet and they say no you you give him my car and say hey they're a preferred lender they are bank he's been doing this for 25 years he really takes care of our customers give him a call and then I'll ask all those questions right yes when you give rather you give me their name and number because it's easier than someone 0 they're going to call you and then it's a week later and I don't get the phone call right because how serious you if it's a week later right my eight out of 10 times are not serious OK so I'd rather you give me their name and number and then I call and then I will ask hey what do you think they're looking to buy because they do come to you and say hey I'm looking to buy a condo I'm looking to buy one family I'm looking to buy 2 family and then I'll I'll go deeper into the conversation OK my goal is always to put them in the conventional law why best rates like I said if you put 10% down 5% down or 15% down like Fern says once after I think it's two years and if you hit 20% the PMI goes away without you refi if you got a good rate yeah the property goes up enough to get a 20% how would you do that Pat how do you have an appraiser come out or what happened so no so whoever we sell anybody whoever servicing alone those you know you call the servant you call the mortgage company say hey I think my I've been here for five years said I think my house is worth more than what I bought it for I want to get rid i'm making up time right I want to get rid of the PMI and if they do do that if they look it up on their OK here's the address 0 I think we can they'll sit do a drive by just to make sure the house is what the house is and usually they get rid of the PMI that's if you have a good rate but most likely they get nine out of 10 times it's a refi it's not a drive by because you know at that point the rate might be even lower than what you got now right people refi every 18 to 24 months for either a better rate get rid of PMI or to cash out deending on how much they put down all right so does that happen often no unless you got a killer rate like you said like during Covid and it's in the twos or threes and you did have PMI you still got that good rate and that's why you'll never want to refi that way So you guys know right I'm a little bit older so I've been doing this for 25 years like when someone calls me in a refi I actually asked the questions what's your rate hey don't do it now some guys refi just because they don't care 'cause they need to get paid for a quarter or three 3/8 of a percent I won't do it unless it's a point because the fees that you're going to spend a refi you got to do title again you got to do an appraisal game you got to do so it's you can put them into your mortgage but it's not going to be worth it unless you put go down a percent it's not the right thing to do OK but that's on me I ask all those questions OK so conventional loans we always try to push our customer towards that right that's my job I always try to push customers towards that especially if they qualify income and credit wise you know what else is really interesting I'm sorry to interrupt no no I like this very very interesting is that sometimes your customers tell Pat more than they tell you it is really crazy like I even had a customer I know that young couple they had more money than they told me they had you know and so it's very interesting how that works so it's best to always direct to the professional so you know don't even try to do that that because sometimes they don't want to tell you they don't want to tell you and I tell them two guys I'm not the IRS i'm on your side so just tell me the income is there something else are you self employed are you running everything off you're allowed to write things off that's what the IRS allows you that's what the laws allow you the tax laws right so I ask all the proper questions and when I give you that pre approval letter unless they lose their job or the property somewhere with the property if the offer gets accepted or the inspections usually when I do the pre approval letter I go a little I'm going to close 9.5 I can give you that little percent I always close the loans when you get a letter and we get accepted because I asked a little bit more questions up front than I need to if there's any doubt because one day tell me how much you make a year a lot of guys who say oh I make 200,000 The law officer doesn't ask the next question a lot of them though oh you make 200,000 great I'll give it a letter i'm there hey he said W2 what is your Commission If in this Commission what's your base What your average commissions for the last two years these are questions that I asked oh no you're self-employed hey can I can I see your two year tax returns your business ones too just because I can add depreciations in if you write off a lot of stuff so I do my homework before I give our customer the letter just to give a letter OK because it's not right if you give a letter to customer gets accepted and then you can't do it all Understand guys we all do goans the same way the basic homes conventional FHA every mortgage company every bank 'cause we go by the Fannie Mae guidelines and FHA guidelines so no one does indifferent except if you structure them if you ask the proper questions there's no reason that once your offer gets accepted and the mortgage company says oh it's 20% down they can qualify conventional that once they actually get all their paperwork in a week you should have the approval again we all do them the same way but unfortunately in our business a lot of people lie and then when they get the offer 30 days later like it it's not accepted you got denied for the loan why you gave me the letter because they didn't ask the proper questions up front and then during the process they tried to see if they can put it together somehow and structure it OK so you're knowing from us anybody you deal with that unity 'cause if you're in New York we have someone else you're in South Jersey we have someone else but they all work for me if we give a letter it's going to get done OK so the conventional loans like I said 5% down one family owner occupied no 3% down one family owner occupied and goes as little as 3% unfortunately in today's market if you don't see 20% and there's five offers still who gets accepted the one with the 20% the one with more down payment and so on it's been like that since Covid so multiple offers but I've done more than that we're 5% down and 10% down we're not going to lie to you people are like OK with what was it 3% i'm not sure I know what she did did she use you cynthia.

=============================================

Seller didn't want FHA so they found a 3% 3% down which I hope customer had it is it is real for conventional but the 3% down you need a seven usually a 720 credit score right Alexandra and that's not my rule it's a Fannie Mae guideline so if you go conventional 3% down you gotta have a 720 credit score hopefully if not and hopefully they did their homework and they gave the letter the right way OK and and like Frank said if you put less than 20% down there was PMI private mortgage insurance every loan has it's a Fannie Mae guideline now how's PMI calculated back in the day was a percentage if you put 5% down it was .78 goes to show you how old I am I remember if you put 10% down it was .53 if you put 15% down I think it was .42 and then 20 there was nothing now PMI is based on down payment property type and credit score the higher the credit score the less PMI you get And that's not interesting yeah which is crazy was never like that now all these PMI companies create we even shot the PMI when we underwrite a loan and put it through DUDU means direct underwriting every mortgage company every bank who deals with Fannie Mae loans has to use DU to get an approval has to go through DU direct underwriting OK that's the only way they'll do them all buy it off your line and now with DU you have four or 5 PMI companies and whoever gives you the best deal you click on them and and that's what you did You get the right thing OK but that's all my job this is just going basics let me do that it's fun for you guys to know what goes on behind the scenes you know to get somebody else is working on it so I'll go real quick I'll size up so I give you the pre approval The office accepted congratulations accepted I get back we Alexandra and I get back to the client and I hear your offer was accepted you you will forward me to I always ask for the contract obviously the name and number of the attorney Alexandra and I do and I copy the listing because the copy of the listing rate has the taxes for the year not that they're A100 percent but at least we know if it's a condo we have the HOA and if it's a condo there's usually the management company's name and number on it OK 'cause we need that and I'll go into that right once you give me that we forward the application online is very simple to the customer and they fill it out online with a list of documents they need to give us to your W twos to your tax returns one month pay stuff all that stuff was on there they submit the application it goes to a young lady named Jill that once it's submitted we put it together jill will email the customer the disclosures they can sign them he sign them online that just keeps the processor by the way no no Jill's the lady who does the I got a whole new team now Jill's the one that does all the disclosures for us When we we get when the customer esigns all the disclosures we get a notification then Betsy our processor puts it into underwriting then the underwriter gives us the approval and the underwriter might say I need updated pay stubs updated bank statements because depending on when we we we get the house in the middle of the month the end of the month or when it's closing what we're going to need before it closes OK my processor or processor collects all that information we get title in the meantime use Regency we can do it from day one don't order title soon as that's it's done with attorney review and if it cancels because something happens to an inspection because there are partners they don't care and they don't charge OK and title state regulated and they're very well known and you want to have control even with the title company where you can call them at any day anytime they're going to pick up the phone if there's a problem with the title and help you resolve the problem And so most attorneys will wait till the commitment is in the mortgage commitment is in before they order title which holds everything up if you need a quick closing you know or at least a firm closing you know you don't closing could be even three months but the fact that they'll do it right away and if something happens to the deal they don't charge your customer they don't charge customer and you want them to order up front because nowadays stuff comes up on title right I had one that he had to go to court because it was a second mortgage on it that didn't get discharged and they had to go to court and we knew ahead of time so we were still able yeah we closed a week later but we were still able to be proactive because we order title ahead of time OK which is very important and again that state regulated so it's not like that title company's charging more than this one doesn't work that way OK and then once the title's in we collect Betsy collects all the documents we schedule closing three days before we have that closing date but I said we schedule closing three days before which Alexandra will show you that later our customer gets ACDA closing disclosure We're the title company and our closure or issuing that preliminary CD if ACD for any type of loan is not issued three days before you cannot close on that house by law has to be three days before and what that means is nothing can change it's set in stone because back in the day mortgage companies used to change the rate change the fees the day before closing and then you go to the closing you didn't know and then they would say hey oh good you have the closing yeah what are these why am I paying 2 points now and you promised me one rate and higher well if you want to close your closure you don't you don't OK that can't happen now because there was too much of that going on and by the way guys if you don't remember to send your Commission statement I can't tell you how many agents forget to request their Commission statement from your admin and get it to the the title company and to the lawyer and it doesn't get there with three days prior minimum you you can't close can't close yeah so you you should be at least a week before the closing requesting that and getting it out to them Commission statements where do we get that from again i'm sorry where do we get that from again your Commission you know let's say you sold the house and 0 you're looking sick again are you OK yeah So you sell a house you're getting a two and A half percent Commission on A $1,000,000 house that's what what is it $25,000 or something like that and you you go to your AT you have it in your zip forms and then you know it's gonna close next week two weeks from now and then you go into my CIR and you order a Commission statement from your AT from your Admin yeah and then she sends it out to the lawyers and the title company so it's just basically what you're bringing into the company OK but the.

=======
Once she does it once she creates it she sends it back for your approval People don't look at it and then it can't be sent out so make sure you watch that it's approved it then goes when you bring the check in it goes to the accounting and that's where it will give your split you know whatever that will come back for your approval and you've got to approve of it right away and get it back to them or you won't get your check on time and also you have to have all the things your there was a thing Brandy just sent out to everybody there's so many people coming and watching us you have to have your all your paperwork done lead paid sellers disclosures all all of that must be in your in your zip forms.

Obviously other name name of the title company and all that stuff you have the loan amount the rate principal and interest right here which is estimated taxes insurance or your escrows which is your taxes and your homeowners insurance if you have an HOA that would be there too if you're buying a condo and if you have PMI that will be in there too OK that's that over there and after that cross that closing those are the closing costs and then what they need for down payment and close OK underneath cash to close now we go to the second page right your CD application fee of 1095 that's our only true junk fee that for Christies we waive OK if we do the loan but what we need to do sorry Fern I'm just going back and forth because that's OK what we need to do is though right we will put it on the loan estimate on the original one we will change it three days before and give him a credit because we can't customize a loan estimate for every customer from day one because not every customer is going to get that credit OK so we have to do it standard and then afterwards we can ask per compliance right and then the other fees are just standard fees right the credit report depending on how many customers are on the loan the flood search tax these are all standard fees your title that comes from your title obviously company your lawyer fees your escrows how much you're paying for insurance for the year OK so you guys all understand I still get this question a lot so when when customers escrow the payments principal interest taxes and insurance and if there's PMI insurance meaning homeowners insurance OK so then they they I have one asking the other day hey why am I paying a year upfront if you're going to escrow it every month and I said that's a great question I said because you're gonna be living in a house for a year and you gotta pay for it now and what you pay every month that's in your payment it's gonna go into an escrow account whatever the monthly fee is and then next year when it's due the mortgage company pays for it but your customer always is not just for me for any lender they do always got to pay one year upfront of homeowners insurance because again if you let's say we close November 15th your first payment isn't due till January 1st So if you don't pay your insurance up front you have no insurance for the year so God forbid something happens so that you get paid off and we credit that as part of your closing costs we put it in here how much it's going to be we estimate how much it's going to be but whatever your fee is when you shop it or your customer shops it that's what the final fee is going to be three days before the closing understand yeah and I'm interrupting again be careful when you have more cash buyers Be very careful because they will forget to get their insurance sometimes yeah sometimes forgets to tell them Il'm in rockland county did something happen yeah a part of that it was a two family in the front with three families units in the back the three family units in the backyard


-----------------

Customer asked you I don't want homeowners insurance ever get a mortgage just stay within the industry if you're ever borrowing money you'll always have to get for a house you'll always have to get home relationships then what you do after is on you but Shelly for that probably cost 2000 bucks for the year even if it costs five for the year divided by 12 and now it burns down you have no insurance you got to pay what couple $100,000 just to rebuild OK so this is what your customer our customer gets three days before closing everything broken down and then what they need to do is if we go back to the 1st page you see the date where it says date issue April 8th of 2025 whatever date that the CD is issued has to be dated because it's three days from the date it was issued and if it was issued on the 8th and the customer signed it you can sign it and dated it tonight we're not closing until 12 see how it says closing on the 11 but if they sign it under 9th it the 8th which a lot of people do right they do it the next day we're closing on the 11th three days after that OK but legally we have to wait three days So we'll make sure you you when I say you guys are backseat drivers make sure you're aware of that pat will always be on top of it you know Alexandra will be on the top of it but but you also should be on top of it because some you know people get so many emails and so you know because that comes by email right yeah it does and listen guys it comes from our closer right who's a different name right so but Betsy is good I'm good Alexandra's good that after we issue it if we don't get a back sign the next day they can eshine it to we'll call them up and say hey we issued a CD yesterday if you want to close in three days why haven't you signed it yet oh I forgot i'm sorry OK make sure you sign it i'm not telling you if you want to close say on the 11th make sure you sign it on the 8th the day was issued you don't have to sign it on the 8th for whatever day you sign it that's three days after that and then everyone signs it up in detail it was issued even though the next day because it's not repeal OK so you understand that that's very very because I've had people I need to close tomorrow your attorney and the title have an issue to CD yet can't close but I need to close i'm not gonna be around you can't close I told you from the beginning you need to issue we need to get this done three days before and so on and I explained that all to him in the beginning how the process works because some people do get angry right so and that's what II try to calm on them and I set expectations from the beginning if you guys if we have a good customer and there's 10 offers and you say Pat can you close in 30 days because I talked to the listing agent they say the seller wants to get out of there and all these nine offers want 60 days can you close in 30 does your customer want to close in 30 you're going to tell me yes and if I feel that the customer is good enough that we can close in 30 days and that's me after I ask him all the questions and run their credit and all that stuff I'll put in the pre approval letter your approved for 600,000 with 20% down closing can happen in thirty days legally I have to wait ten that's just the law but I've closed loans when there wasn't a law in less than 10 days And if the customer is good and say you call me Pat you think we can do this in 30 days 'cause I think we can get it and I'm gonna say yes I feel confident 'cause I don't know that by the customer and don't be afraid to have the listing agent call me there's multiple offers You can tell the listing agent A if we're close or whatever you want to say my lender said you can give him a call if you have any questions from that and from an experienced patent I had together the I put that into how to create a perfect contract that the listing agent is invited to call the the the mortgage banker and then it put their name in and so forth but I had a young couple was two years ago maybe during Christmas right around yeah right before Christmas right and they they were great customers but we we made 7 offers and they couldn't get an offer they couldn't get anything because they had minimum down and then finally we were close and I talked to the listing agent I said look if you're worried about them here call Pat turns out she was Italian he was Italian they started talking Italian before you knew it they were best friends we were best friends and I got the deal and we got the deal and we closed in 15 days because we knew the custom I the customer that she they were great customers Oh my God II need some it's not and two minutes is there so we got everything like this excellent credit great income and it was a great story too 'cause they wrote a letter at that time I think you could her in her family she had few a little family here they just had a baby they lived right around the corner so we need my family to help this is where we grew up blah blah blah we just said baby be my husband I was talking to her in Italian she moved to Florida she and it was her personal house so she came here just to sell the house in Florida i'm like listen I'm going to close you just trust me you know we start talking Italian and we close and they are so happy but they were really cute customers they go for they were referred to me by a previous customer and they and they were this is the way they were they were so nice they said you know we we want to be the best customer you ever had and were they not with pat order as this but they spent the entire week in getting every single document he needed to get it closer in a timing man and I made
 to get it closer in a timing man and I made to get it closer in a timing man and I made.


 ----------------------------------

 This is what they need you want to close on time just give me what we need I don't make the rules I just following and so on so but yes if we have the right customer and we need to put that in a letter and we are going up against multiple offers please I put it just say Patty think we can do this because the listing agent said I think we'll get the offer if we can close in less than 30 days or we can close in less than everybody else that's out there and I'll tell you yes and I'll get it done unless the customer doesn't get the stuff but but I'm pretty good at judging when I talk on the phone that I don't know yeah I feel confident do it and I recommend that the listing agent calls me I can't tell you how many deals I've gotten for our for you guys because I've talked into the listing agent and they know who I am up here and they know if pack there's a letter it's going to close so which is pretty cool but it took me a long time to earn that reputation but it's pretty cool and I do get it done OK and let's do and let me do that for you and what's really about us is right which I always tell the customer listen if my break today is 6 1/2 and we're closing again I'm going to say 30 days or 45 days which is the normal and the rates go down between now and the 45 days I give it a lower rate for free is that an extra fee with a lot of other banks do oh I can give you a lower rate for again it's that's how they sneak in points the rates have gone lower but I can do this and they give it to your customer because again I don't get paid on rate I get paid on loan amount and it's a percentage of the loan now so I don't get paid on fees it's just a loan about OK so I do that for a customer I put him in a proper program depending on where you buy when people a lot of loan officers still try to push a lot of people FHA you only go FHA for a couple reasons just nothing wrong with FHA one they don't have the down payment of three of more than 5% because FHA for one in four family owner occupied property you're allowed to put as little as 3 1/2% down for owner occupied only FHA you cannot get investment properties on FHA only owner occupied homes OK so 3 1/2 percent down you go FHA they have a 620 score the PMI is remember I told you PMI is based on credit score FHA has the same thing MIP If you have a 620 to a 680 it's cheaper to go FHA than it is to go conventional because of the insurance premium the insurance premium for FHA is just a percentage it doesn't matter the credit score OK so just to put that on me but if we need to do FHAI do them too OK only owner occupied properties you go FHA cuz you have a 620 score you go FHA because you can qualify for a little bit bigger home you go FHA because for a two family 3 family 4 family home you can use up to 75% of the rental income to help you qualify towards the mortgage OK besides your income of your job but that's all my job I'm but conventional too you can use the rental income by 75% It's more conventional I told you you can only go up to a 50 per DTI when you take your mortgage payment plus your debt divided by your gross monthly income FHA allows you to go to a 55 so it gives you a little bit more of a house to qualify for and FHA don't be afraid it is coming back back in the day no one liked it because you know they were afraid oh because of inspection issues or if the house needed some work it's not as strict as it used to be OK but again I only push people that way if we have to so they need to qualify for more of a home based on their income in their credit so Pat let's say somebody how are we going to overcome it because people are having FHA customers and sellers don't want to accept them they still believe Oh my God they're going to have a nightmare during these inspection what how does the process work the homeowner the buyer gets their own inspector to their normal inspection and then the FHA comes in FHA inspector it's an it's a it's a an appraiser that's licensed for the FHA and knows what FHA wants right FHA guidelines to property people think that a new inspector comes in just squash that idea squash it it's a it's a every house needs an appraisal and every appraiser or at least eight out of 10 appraisals or license everyone's licensed for conventional but eight out of 10 are licensed to do conventional and FHA you need to be approved by FHA to do an FHA appraisal there are appraisers who we use but you need to be approved OK we use a guy named Paul that does a lot of my appraisals but he doesn't do FHA so when I get an FHAI give it to our other person and every appraiser for every company has to belong to a management company So they're on a rotation with a management company that we use because when the meltdown happened in 2008 the problem was right there was no checks and balances for appraisal so they would put whatever value they want And then when the market crashed in 2008 what they realized was all these appraisals were overhyped and the bank lost money because of foreclosures and when they went to go sell that same property see that it price for 800 it was really 6 And they're like oh and they realize that on the most of the properties right it was the same appraiser for the same mortgage company that was just doing whatever they wanted to make the deal work right unfortunately there was no checks and balances not only for it's for everybody So then Fannie Mae and FHA came out hey if you want to do a Fannie Mae or FHA loan you have to go through a management company just because they don't want to see him appraisal for every loan at that point in time the abuse by the banking system especially with builders was unbelievable I had my own company that then so I was a female minority owned company so I got a little bit of rating there and and so they hired me to do due diligence on properties and it's the base didn't even know where some of these properties were I was all over the United States and we would go and they they said could you find documents can you find this property I go to out in the wilderness and there was somewhat of a street beautiful curves but no Mcadam and maybe one house built and the bank didn't have any oversight didn't know that these houses and there was the loans that were out yes Improvement loans was amazing unbelievable and that was just one I mean there were yeah it's crazy listen I know I know one or 2 appraisals such single handedly broke down the housing market in Patterson appraisals for the same mortgage it will sell the house for 657 and then six months later because that's when the market was going crazy that same house would go for 750 and they would just go back and forth back and forth back and forth until the market crashed and then everyone has the same rules we all go by the same guidelines every management every mortgage company has a management company that they have to use the appraising now the beauty about it are appraisers They know Jersey they know Pennsylvania we don't get appraisal from New York to do New Jersey to do a Jersey appraisal so I I'm doing one from Chase now honest to God they went to Chase they bought a condo chased and do their homework 30 days into the project when you buy a condo one nowadays remember what happened in Miami 4 5 years ago I was playing up with the OR three years ago when the whole high rise collapsed fannie Mae then came out with an extra section of their condo questionnaire whenever you do a condo you have to do a condo questionnaire every company does unless it's on a Fannie Mae website that the development is approved fannie Mae or FHA by Fannie Mae yeah none of them are Not anymore None of them so when you do this condo questionnaire the Fannie Mae added a section hey I can't remember this question is glued it's burnt right here has there been an engineering inspection in the last three years It could have but no one fills it out no one fills it out because God forbid it does fall down even though it said the inspection that engineering was right that that condo attorneys are saying you can still get sued that's the problem but you can get sued just because you like like to look at somebody and sue them and just sue anybody that's the problem with our legal system that's the problem with but on that part if they don't fill out that section even though they it was done and you heard that it was done and it did pass If they don't fill out that section you can't go for anybody and you can only go portfolio which we'll go into but with the appraisals so you guys know so let's say we do get an appraisal which happens very rarely If it does under appraise my appraiser will call me hey Pat listen we're XYZ short If it's 50 if it's 10 G's I get it 15GS it depends how much I begged that day I get it I will never put your license or the appraiser's license on the line I will never do that for anybody so under appraises you don't do it alone no that's what I'm going to get at so if it under appraisal say Pat I can't do it I try and you still believe in your heart that it's worth it and you get me additional comps 'cause say sometimes you got cops that the appraisal doesn't see or doesn't believe in you give me additional cops I bring another appraiser out there If it comes in I pay for and we use that new one with the number that it appraised No I don't care what anybody says no other company will do that because once an underwriter sees 1's appraisal no we've seen that and what they do is they just send the same guy back out Yep so back to my Chase deal Chase This customer is buying a condo in Cliffside Park One park beautiful high Rush 91 I know 'cause I've done 567 loans in that building and now they all call me but chasing do their homework plus when I looked at the appraisals name it came in thank God the value but now we're going to have a problem they want me to use that appraisal I can't unless they put it in my name the appraiser was from Ohio the company i'm not saying they flew in from Ohio the company's from Ohio so you know whether where they got disappeared could have been an appraiser from New York that works for them could have been appraiser from Pennsylvania and over there the company name was from Ohio Their Chase they can do whatever hell they want there's no control there chase can't say oh I can call this person they don't even call the appraiser because even if they were able to the underwriter doesn't like it you're not getting it done we will OK we can use it if we have a new appraisal because my underwriters are cool like that this this office here this Christie's organization and Ilia the owner our CEO and our Chairman of the board are very good thanks they become very good friends not only for business but personal so there's a lot that we do for this company especially if you're point twenty twenty five percent down that a lot of other companies can't do because if it doesn't meet Fannie Mae or FHA by the state can't do it 'cause they sell everything we keep our loans on our books some of them yes and when went

 Portfolio loans

 But they raid off 1.9 inventoried expenses blah blah blah because they can't so they don't get killed on taxes right fannie Mae we can only use 100,000 it's after expenses and it's a two year average so how's the person see with a $100,000 income AKA Elvis on that first one 25% down can buy a house for 950 can't they don't qualify on paper does it mean they can't pay for it but on paper they don't qualify as per Fannie Mae in FHL us we do portfolio lending which means we make it's our own bat and ball but we have some requirements 680 to 700 minimal credit score i've done the work depending on the deal we diagnose each deal 20 to 25% down besides the credit good grocery seats out of business good reserves in the bank it meaning if you have a 401K or you have investments they don't have to be in our bank but if you put 25% down plus you're closing you still have more money in other accounts so those are called reserves OK so you have good reserves in the bank we usually ask for six for 12 months and it doesn't have to be in Unity Bank OK and I've done loans on My Portfolio up to a 200 debt to income ratio because we like the customer we actually look at the customer when it comes to portfolio we look at their business someone who has $500,000 in the bank and they only show that they're making $100,000 on paper we know what they're doing nothing bad they're writing everything off because they're allowed to ask for the IRS guidelines so they don't get killed on taxes and then those rates that we do on portfolio are a little bit higher but that's my job to get right so I sit down with the customer say hey so if you show me two years income and it worked on paper you can go conventional here's your payment but you need to make instead of 100 you need to make 300 you need to pay your taxes to the IRS on 300 you need to redo your last two year tax returns and pay whatever taxes 'cause you have to redo your input because whenever I need a two year tax return or we can leave it as is Here's your payment on the portfolio And look instead of being say 4000 is 4300 are you OK with that 'cause if you're not then redo your taxes and pay all your taxes and maybe get some penalties yes and you know that Mr Groffett will take this program right there and yes it's a higher rate yes a little bit more but I can afford to pay and so on and then I tell them nicely right you got two years to make enough money on paper and this is the number you want to go to help you qualify for the loan on a conventional loan but that's what I do OK so we throw them in a portfolio that nobody else that's how I got here my first 5 deals in Christie's were portfolio loans because nobody else can do it and everyone was a triple factor 34 deals this is what advantage you have if you have a customer who self.

 OK during Covid what did remember during Covid right there was people needed to sell their home to buy a new home right but you couldn't because there were 20 offers and that's where all their down payment and closing was in that house But no one was going to wait because there was 20 offers i'm not waiting sales contingency I remember the phone call happened to be there ilya from downstairs who's the owner calls our CEO hey Jim we're having problems here some of my agents aren't getting their offers accepted because they have a contingency of a sailor hub actually Karen's husband was one of them you did him you did that that loan for oh the one who yeah yeah you did a bridge zone we took the equity out of that that they're selling and you can still leave it on the market and sell it it's listed we took all the equity for down payment and closing I knew they can qualify for both and if they don't we put it on our portfolio anyway to make the debt to income exception because we know they're going to sell it we don't ask them to take it off the market we want you to leave it on the market in many cases you can't couldn't get a bridge loan unless your home was off the market or an equity loan if your home was you couldn't have your home on the market and we don't care .

 She didn't like she didn't like the rape And I told her the rape listen the one thing you're gonna get from us you're gonna know your rate and your fees from day one the only thing you're gonna get better if the rates get better I'm gonna tell you when the rates go lower and I told this she was an older woman so she was old school She gave it Fern gave me the customer i'm like this is the rate and these are their fees because I can hear it in her voice 25 years of doing this she's very sensitive like that I know what to do are you OK with this Yes Are you sure and it's interest only was Bridge loan interest only one point yes and then all of a sudden this poor lady how many times you go there to her house I was surprised she's she's still working with me OK and then she calls that little one day I don't want to do it no more did it sell but it happens something you know did the Glen Rock House is sold but it didn't close OK but it's sold right I think they're still in process of selling it that I think the last thing that happened is they found an oil tank and she's going hysterical over there so they're removed she's got a estimate to remove the oil tank Oh my God Yeah it was but my point is we can be creative we can do it where I had another customer who had 10% debt they owned an investment property that they wanted to keep the low mortgage on it right but they had to go portfolio remember what I said in our portfolio we won 20 to 25% debt because prepare and have it no problem I go up to my CEO hey his name is Jim jim they got this investment property that's worth 700 there's no mortgage on it can we put a lien on that house too and only put 10% down on the new house they want to buy and use that as collateral well on paper think about it right if it's worth 700 there's no mortgage on it right it's more than 25 20 25% down if we take a lean nobody else does that we do it i've done many deals with that if your customer wants to buy an investment property one to 4 family and put in an LLC we put that in our portfolio one to four family and usually for any other lender especially any bank and LLC loan is a commercial when we do a commercial loan there's a prepayment penalty right My owners like listen if it's one to 4 family it's our money you can put in an LLC and there's no prepayment penalty because in the state of New Jersey it's illegal to have a prepayment penalty under residential loan and we treat it as a residential OK which also helps our clients because when I tell them there's no prepayment penalty and D one doing it in LLC like oh jeez really OK let's do it that way on an investment property now those rates are higher we show a little bit more but again that's my job I break it down and tell them right when we have a condo this is myt.

 consturction loan: research more

 There's a formula but that's on me we do do a lot my number one guy here in Richwood Bob Jenny 80 plus loans I've done with him in the last 8 years all construction loans we give the money to buy it and we percentage it as for a formula and we give them money for construction knock on wood I got another two last week and so so whenever you have a customer whatever the situation is you let me talk because I'm pretty good at it and I'm always going to tell them the truth explain the construction loan to everybody so when we do a construction loan it's a simple formula until we build a relationship if it's a builder we take purchase price of the property plus construction costs whether it be do an addition or whatever they're going to do to it which equals total cost and we give the builder 70% of the total cost now obviously we're going to give you 70% to buy it so let's say for example the budget is 500,000 but as per the formula of 70% of the total cost I can only give them 400,000 So that means before we can lend we're going to give you the money to buy it with 30% down but there's $100,000 short right before we can lend you a dollar on construction you have to put in your additional 100 first now have we worked with the customer where hey you put in 50 this time we'll put in 50 then by the time you need your next draw get another 50 or 25 and we'll match up with the 25 we do that that's for builders 70% of the total cost and when you say builders they have to be what qualifies them as a builder you know that's great question listen I'm going to make you guys laugh you ever guys ever been to Clinton NJ so click it yes it's form right a lot of form a lot of so I tell everybody 'cause that's where my corporate is we're I'm not going to use the first word but we're a bumble whatever bank from Clinton NJ So in any other place does a builder need to have at least three projects done yeah not our place if you got to build it 1st time and trying it we'll let you do it alone because we don't go that deep into it OK you understand so if somebody you know I'm doing two now that he's a first time builder because you have my cousins doing this house and he told me to do it he's going to help me in this is my first house and we do him and so on and he's AGC so our buyer can be the GC but that's me explaining now we're doing a construction loan firm for you're going to live in the house will do up to 75% not 7075 because you're going to live in a house now the reason why we do 70 and 7570 remember if they're going to keep the house as an investment property and God forbid the market turns a little bit there's enough equity there because when we do open appraisal we go off the plans in the budget for future value but you know houses usually take 12 months to build so the market could shift a little bit so we want to make sure there's enough equity there to to cover that if you decide to keep it in refinance it you still meet the guys line for equity if you're buying it to flip it then it doesn't matter and also for if you're buying to live in it when you we do the end loan once it's like almost done a month before it's done again we want to do a refinance we want to make sure there's enough equity that there's no PMI and we also want to make sure that when I pre approve you the first time to do the construction loan your income is enough and your debt is enough that you can go into a regular loan but that's again that's too deep is that like a refi then or just automatically slides we don't do OK back in the day they would do OK after 12 months it converts into a 30 year fixed the reason why they don't do that anymore if you don't do it it's because the market is so volatile that you can't lock in a loan safe the rates are 6% today and then something 12 months down the road they go to 7 1/2 we lose on that low because there's no 12 month lock in. There's a 30 day lock in. 4590 75 and 90 i've only done up to 75 the longer we wait to lock it the rate is the 30 day lock. Is is lower than the 75 day lock. Because again they're protecting themselves they're hedging themselves on the market in case it gets worse OK so that's why but yes you have to go through a whole refund title and appraisal and so because again no one knows what happened with the market in 12 months so we have to do a whole new return but there isn't much we don't have if you have a customer that owns a home and they need a home equity loan I give them to my home equity loan department I don't do them but we do them myself back OK if we do another appraisal I know if I said this but if you believe in your heart and under appraisals and we do another appraisal and it comes in not only will my underwriter use that appraisal I'll eat the cost they're paying for the first one but I'll tell them that guys listen if the new if you want to do a new appraisal because we all believe it's worth it whatever that number is we're going to use that number if it comes in higher or the number that we need it to be I'll pay for it If it comes in the same number as the previous one or lower we'll still go with the higher one but you have to pay for the 2nd one too And I just make sure again I make everything clear up front 'cause I like spending people's money I'm cheap so if I don't want that done to me I'm not gonna do it And so on OK but that's that on appraisals OK now let .

 I told you earlier who was here no customer now should be paying any points when you're a mortgage broker or a Mort You work for a lender that just does mortgages you're not a bank And I was that guy right the Morphe's like I told you we charge junk fees origination fees discount points commitment fees underwriting fees title review fees what else Alexandra that you you come across doc prep fees all that BS those are called junkies because the lender that's how they make extra money again if everyone's fighting for the same piece of the pot before when we were doing 20 30 40 loans a month no big deal now because not because there's no work there's a lot of inventory right How do you make up the difference by charging fees by charging higher rate unity Bank does enough as you can see on that closing disclosure the only true jump would be we have is an application fee and if I do the loan on the conventional side or FHA side I'll give you a credit I'll give our customer credit at the closing OK we do have some points on our construction loans like the loans that are short term like construction if we do an LLC loan because it's a niche product we do have a point on that that's just cost of doing business right because it's a niche product OK but otherwise on a regular traditional loans even on owner occupied portfolio loan we do not charge points if some lenders charge rate lock fees or buy down fees so if I re lock your rate to a lower rate the lender is going to say oh I'll lower your rate but you got to pay me XYZ the lender not me the lender we don't do that OK because at the end of the day we have such a good relationship with the organization plus we care about the customer most important but we have such a good relationship that we're not going to jeopardize one loan and jeopardize the relationship for the whole I think I think what you have to look at is number one we want the things done do it yes number two is that there is a benefit and what are the benefits the benefits are no junk fees the benefit is if you lock a rate and the rate goes down you get the lower rate the benefit is that they have a means if for some reason you're not the underwriter doesn't approve this that you have the option of going to become a portfolio loan That only works when you have 20 20% down or 25 depending on the deal if it's investment So I want to give you another example we have plenty of examples since I've been here so Celia who also worked in her Mama office she listed the house they sold it and the proceeds from that house were gonna close on the same day so if you have a sale and you and you're buying a new one we usually do the sale in the morning if all the money's coming from there and then in the afternoon or the next day we do the purchase usually you can do it in the afternoon now anyway the customer II was doing a buy he sold his house so the buyer he's doing the new mortgage and it got approved Fannie Mae loan he can only put 5% down and we got it approved Now it's a 10 days before the closing and he gave me all his paperwork like updated pay stubs updated bank statements and all that stuff and when you do a Fannie Mae loan or FHA loan it's got to go back remember I told you everyone uses DU whenever you do it's got to go back through DU to get approved eligible once you check off all the boxes that we got updated stuff all of a sudden DU said it's not eligible and I looked at it from 30 days ago Same credit same income less debt what the hell happened and no one knew because DU changes stuff all the time get the change but but but it usually doesn't say eligible to ineligible this one day now I turn white like I don't like disappointing people the worst part of my job when someone I call somebody I go i'm so sorry I have to say this I can't do you long I hate it i'm getting getting old makes me weaker OK getting older so I go up to my boss and go Mr Hughson and he sees me all flustered he's like what's up I got a big problem he goes what I go I got this christie's loan OK this is my first year there Celia's great they sold their house we're 10 days away from closing the money from there is going here but they can only put 5% down it was approved nothing changed now DU says it's not approved so what's the problem I go what don't you understand I said to Mr Hughes again the coolest guy you ever met it said no he goes but what's the problem I go he sold his house and it's 5% down he goes throw it in a portfolio I can't throw in the portfolio you want 20% down this is only 5% He goes yes you can because I make that decision and if you're telling me DU hasn't changed and we put out a commitment yeah we put out a commitment we're going to do it with 5% down on our portfolio and we're going to charge him no PMI because we don't like that again we want 20% so there would never be PMI well my point is once in a while because of the relationship if something stupid like that happens any other companies can say sorry we can't do your loan no more right because do you say no now even though they said yes beforehand we had the ability to throw stuff in a portfolio that nobody else does and that's great when I told the guy then he goes wait you wasn't gonna do it that way Yeah he couldn't believe it chile couldn't believe it silly is one of the top agents out of our model So again we're pretty flexible like that any other company can't do it because it doesn't they don't have the option of keeping it on their books unless you're a hard money lender and a hard money lender you guys know what hard money lending is when when our customer really has bad credit or builders used to go a lot of hard money because they didn't ask for documents right you put 30 35% down but you were now hard money I think is 3035% down 12% interest only with two to three points Think about that Some people got to go because no matter what they do it doesn't work and the builder that hard money doesn't care as long as you put 25 30 35% down they don't care they're protected and they're charging 12% in two to three points so that's hard money then there's no rules they can do that too because they're using their own watch but this is a little bit little things that we can do shrimp environment if you get a pre approval from somebody else and you don't know you have a right to call them like I told you buyer's agent listing agents call me I recommend that I don't go into detail yet they got a 720 score they got this they got that they work here in the summer statement but I tell them listen I'm doing this 25 years Fern I'm doing this 25 years when you if you were to listing agent at render credit you got great credit great income great reserves this is a no brainer for me OK you can call me anytime during the process but I'm telling you I'm not going to issue a letter unless I know I can close it and plus I'm their preferred lender this what I tell the listening eject so i'm not going to ruin one deer deal just to make a lie and not close this deal call me anytime you want then nine out of ten times our customer gets it plus they all know me like I said around here or in Bergen County community bank so the the the thingu.4

 Of are there any junk fees involved because it it I'm not saying that that's your part that's your wheelhouse you know that's where you should be but you should at least make sure they understand that that you know rates are rates you know and and yes we can manufacture lower ones by increasing points increasing junk fees you know but then you have to look at that what are those two things on your loan the extra rate and then the APR the APR so the APR is always higher than the payments based off the initial rate don't ask me the APR but the it's formula where they include closing costs which doesn't change your payment but the higher the APR compared to the original rate means that the more fees that they're charging you so I love Rocket Mortgage I really do I love Chase I love TD because again what is customers fixated to rates that's what I care about'cause that's all Oh my God Mr Ray and like I told you if I'm if you call three companies and two or a quarter off and one is like a half to 3/4 off it should ring a bell right why do you have a special rate than I do because we deal with Fannie Mae so there's fees you involved so Rocket is very well known so make sure you tell your customer that hey before you sign with Rocket you can use the pre approval to get them the house but before you do your mortgage with Rocket make sure you look at their loan estimate and 1 customer honestly got it keeps saying this the rate was so much lower and the customers like they're like Pat how is your rate higher than this go can I look at your loan estimate $17,000 in fees for a difference in rate I think of like three eighths of a point which made the payment not much different I go wait a minute this is my job this is where I'm a good salesman wait you can pay $17,000 each to save say $200 on that what you're going to refine the next see a worst case scenario 24 months 200 * 24 months is 4800 bucks you're not going to in order to get to that 17,000 it's going to take you whatever five years and in five years you might have refried twice already and pain double the closing costs do not pay points and they had no idea they would pay points because the rocket is a call set chase is a call center and you're not dealing with the same person every time so they're just there to celebrate the chase also have that kind of junk fees too Now what when Chase Bank of America those big banks want a certain product you can't compete like I lost one to Chase the jumbo loan because the guy had a lot of money in their private equity so those guys get whatever they want 'cause they don't want the money coming out Yeah if you happen to have a high net worth in your client and they have a tremendous amount of money in that institution it would be hard to jumble loan and the rate was so crazy because he had a couple million dollars in the bank and didn't want to lose him to take a couple million dollars off wait I got $2 million in your bank and you give me this rate and the one guy too great story too he owners


 ---------------------


 Yes all those so the guy comes to me because his stepdad owns the Kia in Bridgewater and another dealership and I do all their loans So I gave him the rate he's fine and that's what the rate was at the time right so all the Suns two weeks he didn't respond and he was the coolest dude young kids getting married Why have you been ignoring Betsy for the last two weeks she goes Pat I'm going somewhere else but what do you mean what rate did you get I was at 6 1/2 because I got five and 3/4 from Chase I go bro get the F out of here there's no way we had a relationship like that he was laughing because Pat I'm telling you so he shows me his loan estimate I go can you do me a favor how did you get that rate 'cause it was not enough 'cause my uncle owns Benzel Bush and he has all his lines of credit that everybody wants to buy a car millions and millions hundreds and millions of dollars Benz will booster financing that one day when he goes what right did they give you 6 1/2 he goes what did you say he calls up the guy from he calls up the guy from Chase goes wait that's my nephew look who I am in your system look at all the money I have in your system and look at all the business we do on the car loans of your system all of a sudden someone called him you got five and 3/4 they gave a rate that nobody else could get because of the relationship so that's the point right like you said yeah but that's rare it varies very rare but yeah he got it So but this is what I'm good at the only thing I'm not good at is co-ops My suggestion to all you guys if you get a whatever building they like Ash the management company there who does the mortgages in this building they'll give you a list of lenders 'cause they're already approved and it'll be easier to get 'cause in in the Co-op you don't own you own shares like a stock certificate and it's a nightmare I did one 25 years ago it didn't even do it I finally got it approved and 25 years ago it was A Million Dollar Co-op which was a lot of money in Fort Lee and then the guy went to the management company and the management he had to have an interview with the Co-op not the Co op board had to have an interview and they rejected say no we don't want you here and the loan was clear to close and he closed our house or the property you can also look in the tax record and it'll give the banks in the past you know that they have to call a bunch of them because some were in and then they were out because if they were way back when before this whole thing happened you know when the rules changed on co-ops too even the number of people that can be renting in the coop versus owning and yeah all that we're going to go over that next week the rules and regulations for coops you know but and and those rules regulations affect the banking side of it too Yeah yeah so but that's that there isn't much we can't do So what I am going to tell you what I ask of you is if you get a letter from somebody else because you don't know the client and you don't understand call me or Alexandra we're not that all you got from them we're not going to help you no I've i've gotten letters from the relationships I have here have you ever heard of this bank no have you ever heard this mortgage company you know and I'll tell you what to ask if there's a cash buyer and nine out of 10 you got to ask for the bank statement right And you think it's funny I had 10 yeah a fake fake they were buying they said they had $15 million in the bank by cash like a real big house the young lady wasn't feeling it in her stomach so she called me I said email me the bank statement not gonna say nothing and the numbers were off Have you ever looked at your bank statement and the numbers in a corner were off and you know what was really all for me Fern which is very rare and I see bank statements every day we do the ending balance was zero cents every not like it was like let's say eight million five hundred and sixty seven dollars and zero cents yeah that's never like that never because you got interest you got this you got feet you got fees you got deductions and stuff like that and I go doesn't that and I go do you have two months of it no can you get me two months of it and the month before yeah zero cents like this is not right I go I think that's not right because of that and looking in the corner I guess what it wasn't it wasn't right the girl never they made it up yeah people because now with I don't know all these products these programs you can make everything up the font and everything and it's easy not only is he a great.



 -----------------------------------


 Thank you God she says it right i'm going to make her laugh So back in the day right now every client signs what we call a 4506 they've been what that means is it's part of your application package that whenever you gain these tax returns WTO's pay sales we want to make sure it matches what you file with the government well back in the day you still have to sign up but no one executed it now you have to execute it it's been for a long time I know people that had pay stubs blank ADP pay stubs in their office and they would make up a job 'cause no one was running the 45 or 6 they give you a number to somebody who was working at that company and they would like you and fill out the employment verification with the way to pay stubs and all that stuff Crazy what I've seen obviously this is way 2008 when it was cowboys and Indians you can do anything you can do anything it was really it was really crazy it was crazy it was like no income no verification you just had to breathe you just had to breathe yeah Mortgage companies that would help and guide you yes you know that IIII knew the company yes like I my uncle bought a house for like 1/2 a million dollars and never reported anything I think it was on welfare and they found a way to do it now you can get away with it and now oh there's another way when Fern said there was the stated income stated assets meaning you put the name of your company if you work or where you worked and we put enough income in the income section that you qualified on paper as long as it made sense your title now the companies that we were selling these loans to would tell us how they check employment they said listen go on this website put the job position and if the income makes sense put that income because that's what we're going from now wasn't only me doing no income no asset verification it was one in two families no money down you got it 80% first and a 20% second and the rates were crazy stupid But again on paper you can't qualify but it was stated income and every realtor was using that program because if you didn't do it that you knew they didn't qualify in your heart they went to the next guy down the road somebody else in your office and they sold them that house so you had to do it even though I knew they could do it on paper you still had to do because that was the program so and then they went as far as cuz that back and then again it was cowboys and Indians there weren't systems where you would buy a house with no money down and come to me we'll buy another house and go to this generator and do the mortgage you'll buy another house with no money down and people are buying 34 homes at the same time with no money down you can never do anything and and then there were the guys on TV and telling you how to do that making money because you hire you know you'd have to pay for the course to learn how to buy no no money down here it was crazy and it was amazing It really was amazing now you can't get away with it like if you stop with me and you go to Chase Chase will know that you or I'm just saying Chase or any other mortgage company they'll know that you work with another mortgage company and they'll ask you hey I saw that you apply with Unity Bank on November 15th why aren't you with them anymore and you have to write a letter hey I was rate shopping I'll try with them and didn't like it and no mortgage was taken and if you lied and you closed on it but you can't lie anyway just because there's systems in place that we know Like they knew the acquiring right they know everything and they audit your loan and you lied you either have 30 days or 60 days to pay it back in full or it's fraud you got to sell it or they say it's fraud if you can't pay it in full and you're going to go to jail it's not worth it not that I've been there was there was one that I thought was amazing because I watched it it wasn't my listing but it was a house in Saddle River and it was on the market for like two years at a certain price right All of a sudden it came back on the market at over 900,000 which was like almost 150 over right what it was and then it turns out it went into default the guy took all the refinanced it somehow because was on the market for that price took every penny out of the house left the state right and then the house was in default and it was sold Yeah auctioned off by the bank but the bank the bank financed it after seeing what it was on the market for but financed it up from 90,900 thousand it's crazy it's crazy I looked and I saw nine $100,000 loan loan on that on that house it was insane now listen you want to try that couldn't happen no couldn't happen when look at you're talking about saddle books some guys do new construction in saddle books none's wrong with saddle book OK so when I say this is going to sound terrible came in future value for bedrooms for baths settle book 1.2 million books it's crazy Well not now for a family no No 4 bedroom four baths OH-1 family home yeah 1.2 million and and I know this cousin is selling one just like that around the corner you got an offer of a 1250 It's crazy just precious but anyway this i'm here for you so never say no to people if they come with their own letter you can always question a letter if you don't know the bank don't feel bad to call me because it's not me giving you the letter alexander we're here to help you we're one big I tell everybody it's the joke that I tell everybody I got 1000 cousins there's 1000 agents in all the Christies you guys are like family to me I want to see you today I want to see you guys close to you whether you're listening or yourself even if it's your listing and there's something on the mortgage commitment that you got from from the buyer's agent and you don't understand it let me go over it with you to see if it's real or not real I will never see something to first of all we don't lie and two I'm never going to say something make the other company look better at the end of the day I I had the same I want you guys to close the deal whether it's with me or with somebody else hopefully it's more with me but in Alexandria but if not hey Pat I don't understand his commitment to fiscal point let me look at it and I'm going to tell you this is what I'm here for I explain how how you might work a situation where a person was putting let's say 25% down and the appraiser was we were short you know the there was a gap and then you you can talk them into going 10% down and go because never give up on the deal Never something like that happens call me call him because we can either negotiate that the appraisal with the seller if the market slows down sometimes we can do that sometimes you know there's a whole bunch there's a few avenues you can go but Pat has a great avenue yeah so it has happened the good thing is when you have clients that put a lot of money down and that's it we do 2 do 2 appraisals and it does under a praise so instead of point 25% down right depending on what that number is and what we agree the final number to be between the two attorneys it might work out that you're still using the same amount of money but on paper instead of 25% down it's really 10% down or 15% down where you're going to have a little PMI but that's me saying it OK and as long as you qualify for the higher loan amount which that nine out of 10 do you'll still be fine yes Sir this came through on the email what is it or which yeah let's see if that goes to show you I don't even know the email so there you go OK here you go here's today's race But umm yeah so so don't be discouraged that if the house under appraises and diplom a lot of money down it doesn't mean we can't do it alone it just means that on paper instead of point like I said 25% down it might be 10% down it might be 15 and that's me explaining it hey you can still get the price because the seller's not moving from this number you still qualify on paper but instead of being say 4000 it might be 4500 i'm sorry because of PMI and that's the money back and there's other ways like you might get the seller to come down in price you know there's lots of ways to renegotiate things and don't ever be afraid of negotiating don't ever be afraid she's exactly what's the worst they can say they say no no The worst thing to say is no I always say try and then if they come back yes we win if they come back no then we find another way it's going you know again if they're putting that kind of money down I've done them where they put the same amount of money they're not taking extra money out of their pocket it's just that the loan to value is not 75 it could be 85 it could be 90 but this still works The songs that there's ratio falls within within the numbers that needs to be to close along and again and that's me selling hey look in two years three years 4 years if you don't refinance and the market still goes up 5 6% the way it is whatever that number is 'cause I always ask before I talk to him hey what's the market been like the last 34 years what's the percentage of the values going up I asked him look you put 10% down now on paper it's been going up 6% every year in the next two 3 years if the rate stays same you can always take out the the PMI and it'll be the same thing and you'll have a lower payment or like I tell everybody Oh my God the rates a little bit higher how many homes have you looked at 10 have you gotten any no this one you've got right yeah yeah the rate's a little bit higher now then the next question I say does a joke how many times a week you go out to eat 3 go 2 so that money that you're saving on that one day for one day a week 4 times a month is the difference in mortgage payment and then 12 months 18 months again 24 months when you refi it's the number where you want to be but you finally found a house in this same house that you're looking at now is probably going to be 4050 2030 whatever that number is depending on the town more in another twelve months and guess what's going to happen you're going to pay the same amount of money because you're paying more for it even though the rates are a little bit down So yeah it it it is always you really have to learn to negotiate things and put things in in proper perspective by asking questions to them you know what what would you do you know basically got you if you have extra money to put down you know and it's sitting in the bank earning maybe 3 1/2 percent maybe 4 if you're lucky in ACD or maybe if it's just in the bank it's at 2 and something you know would you be better off reducing putting it down on your house you know and show them how that works and show them the math of it same thing goes when you're negotiating say what they need to come up $20,000 take that $20,000 figure out what it costs on on a monthly payment reduce it down to a day and and say look forget Starbucks for two days out of the week right I do it it goes reality just like when I sit down with somebody and the credit the number is tight because do me a favor do not buy furniture Do not buy a car Oh yeah do not put extra money on your credit cards do not close your credit cards OK because now when you clothing up now it's been when you close your credit cards even though they're paid to zero your credit score goes lower I explained with them Alexandra hey listen you're in a border if you have a 720 score which you have now here's your rate but my sitting on our credit when we run credit the three scores come up 'cause there's 3 bureaus and we go with the middle score everyone does there's Equifax Experian and Transunion we go off the middle score whichever Bureau it is then it'll say plus 10 + 15 + 20 so let's see we're right on the edge where they can get a real better rate I'll say to you hey guys if you pay your chase you have a balance of 5000 to 2500 pay it down half your score can go up 15 points which brings your rate from this to that paid down 2500 don't use it when the new statement comes in or if we if we need to close it before the new statement comes in print me out the statement with the New Balance I send it to my credit company and I get you those extra points to get you the better rate again I don't get paid no rate I get paid a percentage of the loan so why wouldn't I want to give you a better rate because then you might give it to 10 more people in my name yo this guy tell me what to do where I got a better rate that's the key right so we help people fix their credit we help people raise their credit to get better rates if we had the time but when it comes to credit you always tell our borrowers I do but it's the ratios like do not buy a car or when I look at the credit there's AA car loan and the lease is up in two months listen I see that your lease is up in two months either wait or when it's up don't spend more money a month than what you have now or you can go up to say if you're at 350 to 400 the most Did you want this what not to do when you're getting a mortgage I save everything you will not remember Do not do that guys we've done it before I think I have this the best story is one day I'm in Garfield with a customer right and I'm sitting at a Dunkin Donuts at 6:30 at night me the husband and the wife And then look for some reason my guts telling me the wife went out didn't shop for furniture So I look at her but listen my gut is telling me they're bringing out you will now pick up the furniture already Oh yeah if I go sign there's no money down for a year and no payment well if you go flanagan well if you sign even though there's no payment for a year for the $10,000 balance I got to take 5% of it and use it towards your debt even though you're not paying for a year and if I take 5% of that payment you're not going to qualify for the loan because she goes to me how did you know that I shop I go my God is tell me and the husband was the best I told you we shouldn't have gone there you ain't buying nothing until we close this house I said don't buy nothing until a week later because also loans get audited right by our we sell everything to Fannie Mae to qualify or FHA so when they get audited and they're like oh wait a minute and you close and then you went out two days later and got furniture and you didn't know that or something like that you lied and now they don't qualify on paper and now you got to pay the balance over it's terrible so that's my job Paul when it's tight and I got a good selfish they don't go shopping 'cause you get a lot of people coming you will get people coming from apartments or from You know the city of persons going to a good car so.



 ---------------------------


 We give some family member family cut well they're going to be family member but say a gift from a family member do not put the money in right away because part of my job when we pre approve them how much you have for down payment in closing 20% plus closing is the money been in the bank for the last two months no my parents are giving me a gift OK leave it let's get the house 1st and then I'll tell you how to do the gift which is very easy it's my job and it's simple we give them a gift letter we look at the parents bank statement and show that for the last for 30 days the most recent bank statement showing that there's no large deposit just standard deposits because some people have cash at home so they'll go put the cash in somebody's house and somebody else's bank account But you got to justify the large deposit and the cash you can't say I had cash so do not do anything that's my job on how to do it if you get it from overseas I'll tell you how to do it from overseas still it's not involved it's done all the time so that's gift money OK but that's again how much you have for down payment and clothes i've got 20% is it in your bank no I'm getting it from then I explained what to do and I should download them two when we meet because some people want to listen i'm a face to face guy I do 1000 miles a week my mechanic loves me because everybody else I get the 5000 mile oil change everybody else is probably three months i'm there in a month and a half and sometimes a month depending what month it is i'm up in Bergen County OK Get it let's talk about to sell a concession how did you know he's gonna say that 'cause she just told me right now that everybody know what a seller concession is Tell me it's it's asking the the by the setter to add $1015 out of precision whatever we need to give you back to add to the value of the home to give you back at at the closing excellent but give you back so give you back meaning not in the check it's a paper credit so example when you sales price of 100,000 because it's easier So we got a sales price of 100,000 they got 5% to put down for down payment but no closing costs again it's my job when I ask hey do you have money for closing no all right We can add seller concessions to the loan which means if it's 100 let's say we need 10,000 foreclosing your sales contract is going to be one in 10th and the bar agreed on 100 they want the seller wants 100 so your sales price is going to be 110 I'll give you that number you always give an estimate and it's never over and it's going to be sales price of 110 in the back where it says additional comments you're going to put $10,000 towards the buyers closing costs So now they just got to come up with the down payment and the closing costs are credited on paper now two things gotta happen there you have to qualify income wise which is my job both are all my job and we gotta make sure the house approaches so when you give me a customer I'm gonna call you back and say hey listen they don't have a closing they're gonna need seller concessions i'm gonna need 15GS What do you think the Max offer is going to be OK 100 do you think it's the household appraise for 115 and then you'll do quick homework just to make sure it appraised for 115 yes I do here's your letter let's get it done But you can build up you can build closing costs into your mortgage as long as the house appraises and you qualify income wise and it's a percentage right so if you put 5% down it's 3% the Max you can go up to what's 10% Alexandra OK I think it's three to 15% down it's 3% of the purchase price 10 to 25% down it's up to 6% 25% down payment or more it's 9% that's a conventional loan it's 9% well OK I've never done a loan in 25 years because sometimes sometimes it isn't even foreclosing FHA guys it can be but we can't say it so sometimes it sometimes it can't be for it might not be for closing costs it might be for during the home inspection that they have to the seller they have to pay for this or they have a credit back and forth but you can't say it and I was going to say that too so OK so here's another way of using cellular concessions not only proposing calls so let's say the borrower has closed calls but there was an inspection issue and it's going to cost 10,000 12,000 to fix it OK So 9 edit you can't put a repair credit on your CD the closing disclosure that I sent you you cannot have a repair credit used to be able to yes but not anymore not anymore so how do we do it We put a seller concession we don't change the sales price to go higher we need the same sales price but the sales price is going to be say 100,000 with 10,000 going towards closing costs right because there were home inspection issues we're not going to say what's for repair we're just going to say towards closing costs because that's 10,000 that you're saving in your pocket that you don't have to bring for closing is on the credit on the closing disclosure 'cause the seller gave it to for repair credit and it's very common up here for septic text Oh yeah but the problem with the septic tank is something cost 4050GS you're never going to have 50GS in closer cost unless some guys killing you and you can't even do that because it's against the wall just a certain percentage of it so at the end we do what we the Max we can do and then the other one they either reduce the sales price or they do something on the side but that's between the two lawyers But when I've had gotten into flights with lawyers where no I put a repair credit you can't well then I'm not going to do it anyway then the next phone call is Fern we have a problem They he won't he wants to put his repair credit instead of seller concession well it's illegal you can't have a repair credit because at the end of the day you don't even know if they're going to fix it So why would a lender give you money in a house that's there's some damage and we don't even know if they're gonna fix it right if it's blatantly like that if they do it as a seller concession then they decide not to fix it it's not on me OK I was just umm do they still release that if you ask for 10 and your closing calls was 8 they give you a check at the at the never Nope they never did it and if they did it was illegal No no I'm not saying in a bad way back in the day we can do whatever we want you really can't do that anymore It would go we will reduce it to 8 instead of increasing your 110 say again we're going to use 1000 we would do 108 because I don't want that to save you because you don't it goes away it goes in the air completely i'm not saying anything was done bad but it goes away so if I'm not going to use it all why do I got to let it go away that's right I'd rather reduce your loan amount it's simple fix internal and then an addendum from the attorneys sometimes the attorneys might get **** **** oh well I did it with Wells Fargo then you got lucky then 2011 yeah back then again it was more not in a bad way because Wells Fargo listen they're more those big banks they got auditors sitting they got floors this big but auditors sitting in their office it might have been OK to do that i've never done it so but yes that's we can do so concessions and we try to do it up front sometimes we got to do it after after the contract gets accepted OK and we do an addendum because you're already deep into it Don't be more flexible right the seller will be you know your seller or the selling agent better than I do because you might say hey listen Pat we'll do it later because the seller there's 5 offers and they're not going to accept that and then we'll do it later and at that point they don't care because you're almost there right they're close and so on so that's my opinions for the family name list for condos you know I'm looking for condoms in my yes you you can't the original you can't just press here and then it all comes out you got to give me each development that your parents want it's your parents right want and then we call our processor it's XYZ of this town and she'll look it up for underwriter or look it up under Fannie Mae website but keep in mind that if they won't fill out the questionnaire properly even though it's under approved list they won't be eligible for funding finance it's a pain in the **** question now we are Fannie Mae direct lender which gives us a little bit more flexibility if we have to do something like that on the condo list if it's on the fan you may guideline then that city would have missed a condo questionnaire they don't flood out depending on the strength of the borrower we have sent it to fandom in right because like Fannie Mae doesn't they get hundreds of hundreds of loans a day they're not going to audit each one So we have a pricing guy that if someone has a 780 score 25% down no debt good ratios the likelihood of Fannie Mae picking up that loan is very slow and we're lucky enough because in the other company they got to buy it back we're lucky enough that they re give it back to us we can put it right back into our portfolio at the same rate 'cause it closed already and we can service it ourselves that's where we're lucky Where other companies have to no wait there was in discrepancies or this isn't that you got thirty days to buy back or there's going to be problemst.  elaborate more on this.

 Blender at 6:00 at night 7:00 at night nine out of ten times you're not picking up the phone if I'm up which I am up at 6:00 and 7:00 at night Alexandra's up all the time too we pick up your Phone 8:00 at night 10:00 at night we pick up your phone and answer the question sometimes you win sometimes you lose they still go somewhere else sometimes but we answer your questions Saturday when do people look for homes at night yeah I called you on a Sunday afternoon when that young couple finally made an offer that was accepted and we got the pre approval five minutes 10 minutes if I'm not around actually that night or you're definitely going to get it that day usually on the weekends I got three boys 16 14 and 12 Christians Christians 12 right alexander 12 and I got my third one kid he's my favorite but forget about him we're on soccer we're every every weekend we're in soccer games done now all three will be back at club because high school's over the two older ones I would I didn't get home last night not all poor pot my oldest son had training in Newark and then he trained with the goalie he's a goalie and then he trained with the team his age group and that training was at 9:00 I didn't get home last night till 11:30 so if you called me I would have picked up the phone but we pick up the phone and we give the letters to **** and if we don't we're going to be honest with you hey Fern I'm at a game alexandra's at a game can you wait till 7:00 tonight when we get home or 8:00 in between both of us and then we have a third back up plan just in case you always get it Always get it and if we give you a letter that's unless they lose their job or there's an appraisal issue you will or a title issue you will close on that law because it's my reputation I rather lose the deal say no Oh this bank said they can do it then go we all follow the same rules if they can do it they can do it maybe they're doing something funny or they didn't do their homework and we had a customer it's the best this is the best story ever I like these stories so we had a customer a month ago construction loans not which everyone says they do construction loans until they get there I don't like your rate well I don't understand what changed from what I told you when we re approved you now I don't like it my bank said they can do better now OK cool I know what banks can do Last night she called me Hey Pat remember Jerry yeah two deals he wants to come back know what happened I know what happened because he wasn't getting it from the other bank but I let him go something I learned the hard way right they're not gonna fight you if they're in your mind thinking they can get a better deal doesn't matter you can show him God and they're still gonna go with a better deal and he came back because I knew he wasn't gonna get it with the other bank and we're gonna God willing you alone that's the next phone call we make after we're done but call her last night hey do you mind if you still wanna move forward with my loan and we were trying to get him for three weeks he won't answer Yeah we'll do it and so we get paid sorted out you got to learn and then they appreciate you tell me what time how about you I talk too much it's 12 something


 -----------------------------------------

 And if you don't understand it somebody else's stuff just call me guys call Alexandra call me I mean there's so many fun things you can do to make your contract better for instance you could let's say you're selling a house you're bringing in an offer you raise the price to put in a seller concession but then knowing that you're going to get that concession you make your home inspection really limited because they'll probably be something but you can't say it anyway so now you have maybe only structural on your home inspection because you know if it's depending on if it's 9% with 25% down and it's I have to do my math and it's a million dollar home it's sandy cheese 90GS so it's going to it's going to fix the heating system the hot water system whatever you know so you could do that and yet you're going to a homeowner saying OK I'm going to give you the money i'm asking in a credit and a homeowner in a concession rather and but I'm only asking for a structural for the house you might get the house yeah but that's what she's very good at I never want all the other managers at the other offices are very very good at whatever offices you guys are going to be at that's creativity right there because sometimes you got to be like that OK anybody looking at me like I'm crazy no do you you get it OK and don't be afraid gosh the best thing to do I'm going to give you you know Covid was great for me right because I was busy as hell but now I hate him because what people learned in Covid was they can work from home and us like used to be in every office 2025 people depending the size of the office every day going in doing work making their phone calls from the office shop talk as we call it and that's how like I learned how to be a loan officer all day I would go on the road and then my first job and then at night I would go back in because my manager want me to go back in like 8:00 at night go back in he checked my log this week I do this week I've talked to blah blah blah these places try this way but then I would hear him talk all night to their customers on the phone because then when you got there at 8 you stayed there we all hung out we had a good time but the phone would ring so you pick it up you might get a lead and so on because that's when the rates were in the paper a lot and the phone would ring off the hook right And I learned how to shock your loans Now go to the office talk to experienced agents right take their brain go to an open house yeah if they can't do the open house get an agent in your office that has me before open houses on that weekend 'cause there's no way they can go to 4 especially if they're one person and see if you can go to that open house for them and take their customers that come in as buyers and stuff like that and you never know and that's how you learn I still go to my office in Clinton and we have a bullpen we call it and we just pick each other's brain on how to structure deals and I'm doing this for 25 years and I learned something new every day it was easy to be a million of us which there are a million of us already right but just go in learn pick everyone's brain do the extra and you'll kill it and listen forget that on the preferred lender here Dealt when Remax was up here I dealt with Remax agents keller William agents cobaltbacker agents Wiker agents through all my years exit agents there's no better agency that teaches you guys and gives you all the tools to succeed in here yeah look at her knowledge his knowledge what you get in leads what you get in marketing I've seen it all so forget that in your preferred letter throw me out It's all up to you now they'll give you every tool to succeed it's up to you guys having to go out and put signs in the ground your signs are put in for free they're taken out for free you used to go get them have them taken out have to pay or pay for them how about Coldwell Banker still to not Coldwell Banker Keller Williams to this day you want to use the printer you got a code and you got to pay for your cops You gotta pay rent for a desk for a desk well that's a yeah that's a whole different but my point is fancy remax.


 -------------------------------

 To hire her because she'd never do anything now she's one of the top agents in this company crazy But it it's about actions not listen it you're going to listen of course but it's about taking action if you don't send out those cards if you don't make those calls nothing's going to happen and you got to be consistent can do it for one year not the other right because there'll also be 1,000,000 of us again even 2 million of us if it was that easy keep going you never know you're in the office you never know someone walks in Everyone used to go to me when I first started I was a paperboy I called paperboy used to make 200 Flyers and then it would be one route one day another route another same fires all week and then next week I do the next ones then the following week we do the next one and go to the same offices and then there were mailboxes they don't do them anymore you go into the receptionist won't let you go and they were like go to that go to the mailboxes and put yourself in there and when you open the mailboxes there was five other mortgage companies in the mailboxes too not only yours but I would go every week because you never know that you can walk into the office that day French this guy screwed me on a deal and I happened to walk in it happened a few times pat can you help me with this and there weren't as many programs then but II was lucky enough I was around enough guys hey you could pay this debt down go get a cosigner 'cause people are afraid to ask those questions hey if you don't can you go get a cosigner can you pay down a credit card can you do this can you do that That's what I ask that's what we ask that's how we were trained right no I don't have the 20% down well on paper you can't qualify but can you get it does your dad or mom own a home or if they do what do they do for work Or maybe we go get it to families and we can qualify for more of a property and so on that's what I'm good at 25 anybody can do Oh yeah you got 784 you got 25% down you make enough money that's easy anybody can do those loans which I like those loans so please those are real good laws less headaches for me but that's OK it's the guy who's willing to put it or the girl the loan officers willing to put in the work to help your client and says hey do this this this and that we're gonna get you along i'm telling you the worst part of my job is Mr Mrs Smith I am so sorry what's wrong I just earned your credit I can't do anything But if you can do this this and that maybe 6 months one year we can help you hate that part of my job because I don't like disappointing people I hate it but it is what it is but I'm not going to tell something that they want to hear and then I can't close alone because unfortunately people do that yeah they do they really do sometimes I get rate shoppers and I'm like I run their credit so you guys know when we run credit we don't run a hard pull which if you do enough hard pulls it it brings your credit down we run a softball so it doesn't hurt our customers credit but when I run that soft pool and I look at it hey Pat I'm looking to shop OK listen in order for me to give you a good rate I need to run your credit now some people just say no i'm like OK what's your credit score what's this what's that I ask the questions and then I get the rate and then I can you put it in writing and I do but again I'm doing this all the time all right based on our conversation $600,000 sales price 25% down 780 score according to you this is what the rate would be if it's not these terms let me see let me see the rates for these credit scores it's not going to work and I protect myself now speaking of those rates this is where people are always oh I looked online and it's this rate I have to read the fine print what does the fine print say about Rachel 780 score 25% down different loan amounts even though this is the rate I always tell people read the right there read the fine print and it goes to everybody and this is the story i'm gonna end it with you 'cause my own cousin did it to me OK my cousin years ago moves here from Italy and my parents raised them right so now his brother's here from Italy and he's buying a house he's getting better and he owns a restaurant so a lot of banks go to his restaurant he's got a very good restaurant so I'm doing his brother's own remember his brother lived with me his older brother he goes Pat I just had some girlfriend valley come in and he said the she said the race this this this and that it's impossible Pat I'm telling you they go mike you're my first cousin you live with me since you're 13 years old i'm going to treat your brother he's my first cousin too it's impossible no OK this is what we're going to do What let's go to the Valley branch and I'm gonna act like I'm your financial adviser that was AA branch manager right Fern so we go there 0 and they're all nice to my cousins 'cause they're to cook and the brother at the restaurant hey this is my cousin this is my financial advisor Pat Grande he has some questions right because I'm doing this house hey can I ask you a question yeah what rate are you giving him oh it's this rate I go OK 'cause I read the fund but they didn't know I read it my own cousins didn't know Can I ask you a question So you said 20% down did you tell the credit score No what's the credit score for 25% down 20% down 780 do you know what his credit score is no but you insisted you can get him that rate with 20% down yeah And then I asked a few more questions so I go then I'm like do you know that he has a 720 credit score and he has this this and that Are you still going to give that rate this one said I don't know what do you mean you don't know so she called the loan officer and the loan officer says no we need a 780 score he's got if he doesn't have it he's got to put 25% down based on the 720 score with 20% down this is what his rate is was way higher than mine OK hey guys just be careful where you go now i'm busting their chops OK you should go to someone that you trust and someone's going to tell you the right not someone who's looking 'cause she's a manager of a branch she was just looking the more numbers she brings in meaning accounts mortgages home equity loans they get bonuses they don't know so they both got up they started talking Italian 'cause I speak Italian his brother who I was doing the mortgage for it looks at me while he's talking while his brother's talking to him his pat I'm so sorry please still do my mortgage that was all my older brother wasn't me I told him I'm going to stay with you II said I get it's OK I just had to do it to your brother OK and I did the mortgage and because no one reached the point because everyone's infatuated and I tell them that too well what bank oh did you read the fine print are you doing all that no well I think you're not good this is what they want just educate your quality And sometimes they're just stolen let them learn the hard way Yeah I mean people just look at the rate they look at and it it's the same thing when you're working with them showing homes they look at price you know sometimes and never decide you know so that's where you have to bring it back to reality to their lifestyle you know and let them know that right now asking price is a starting price in those cases And the last thing we'll say is if someone ever says Oh my mortgage company is waiving the appraisal no they're not so you got everyone understands when you do a mortgage not only with me any lender who does mortgages you always got to get an appraisal when you're lending money the only way it doesn't work which happened a lot during Covid was because no one was allowed in the houses right for revising purchases DUI going back to DU who does FHA in conventional tweak the program that they did some algorithm whatever you call that where you put the address of the house in and it recognized the DU if it was really worth the sales price that you were doing it and depending on your down payment and credit score DU would say appraisal waiver That's the only way you can waive an appraisal and then back in the day too a lot of the agents were saying that's waived the appraisal what that means to your customer if they say yes to which you should let me explain that to them yeah say listen you might have to waive the appraisal here and they say what does that mean talk to my lender all that means is if you buy a house for 900 check or a million that's just a million to get and the price is at 900 You're saying to that I'm gonna buy it anyway at 900 I mean at a million even though it raised at 900 yeah and I'm gonna have the extra money that's why as a listing agent and somebody comes in and they waive the appraisal you wanna see it there's still always an appraisal most Asians don't understand that they're waving the contingency not the appraisal there you go waving the appraisal contingency and you are that you have to check to see do they have extra money available to to be able to pay the difference in the gap and that's important so you have a right as a listing agent to say hey can I see the bank statement you make sure they have enough money for down payment and closing especially if they're point 20% down or 25 or 5% down 10% down you can waive it but with the understanding is hey whatever it's short you got to make up the difference unless you .50% down and like we did before it doesn't matter at that point right or 30% down it doesn't matter instead of being 70% on paper it's 80% on paper whatever that number OK but when they're putting that little down and you weigh the appraisal you better make sure they got the money in the bank that you use in telling people that is never suggest that that you are you never suggest to your customer to waive the appraisal or any of the contingencies you could just say look in this market now the people who are getting homes you know their offers accepted are waiving appraisals let me explain how that works or they're limiting the home inspection Let me tell you how that works you know and and the other thing that they might do is some people are even waiving their mortgage contingency if they feel really strong about it so they go to patent that says hey you know we've gone through everything i'm comfortable you're good you know they're so overqualified they might waive that but you never recommend it yes just saying this is the way people are beginning to they are winning the bidding war that they're there is out there Be very careful and make sure you put that in writing too yeah text Because again that terrible word people sue for every little reason now and that's why you don't want to get caught up by it's your word against theirs and depending on that this is how people are getting their offers accepted it's up to you whatever you want to do whatever you come And sometimes 
 it takes them seven offers before Alex where was he.

 I went into town where beautiful town and they put in addition 1000 square foot addition upstairs but in order it to be considered a room a bedroom it's got to have heat This 1000 square foot addition was a bedroom there was no heat So on paper when an appraiser goes there you can't say something I bet it's two rooms two bedrooms because there's no heat so anyway Wendy calls me up for this house they win over 100 jeeps like Wendy because we're on the same team so everyone tells me Pat we're going to over bid it and go what's the sales price to this where they come in there went over 100 jeeps anyway and she told me about this room so I got a cool appraiser I called him up hey Paul listen I have an idea what if we put baseboard heat in this room Will it count as a bedroom yes electric baseboard yeah electric baseboard and they were doing a conventional roll 25% down so it was a perfect customer but I go Paul I'm only asking he goes why are you asking me that Pat I go 'cause I'm only asking you because two bedrooms have heat they put this A 1000 square foot addition they're going $100,000 over and I'm going to need this bedroom in order for it to count because they're telling me three bedroom whatever it is it's going to go in at a 100 so he looks up because absolutely it will go over 100 What you're coming in at and just at the base for he and this one even said to me you don't even have to know too long just plug it in OK no problem that's all I said no problem thank you call back Wendy or agent Wendy let me tell you something just tell this customer let's get on the phone with them I'll tell them about you as well if they're going to go $100,000 over I need them to put baseball heat in before one 170 bucks cost before my appraiser gets there he says we can leave it on the ground no it's at all make sure the listening agents OK with it and they were and guess what the value given the customer was called it explained it to the customer you have to explain it to the customer I didn't want to be the bad guy and you understand 'cause they were going to put heat in it themselves they said it Pat we're going to put our bedroom up there we're going to put heat ourselves in going to do it unless we do it this way because it ain't going to appraise and they didn't have the extra 100 to put down and it worked out but again it's the point of I think it was really thinking of a plug in electric heating thing that you can buy at Home goods and just stick on the wall and it counted And let me tell you guys you know how I learned that when they go into the office back in the day in my early days at 8 9:00 at night one of my guys that I was listening to training me had a customer on the phone And that happened to them and I remembered it I don't remember much but I remember stupid things like that and it saved the deal or we got a deal and she called the listing agent saying hey we have to put heat in there but if you take our offer our guy is saying that he can get that value and we got it and we put the baseboard heat we bought it to sell the buyer bought it they went and bought it for 70 bucks because they didn't care that's how bad they were the house and stayed that but my point is we were creative it's very important and it's so funny because there's there's no two deals the same you know so when you're working out there that's the fun part of this the challenge of figuring it out and helping your buyer and helping them maybe do something that they weren't aware of or being able to provide them with ideas that they weren't you know aware of that they could do especially with the financing I think I think it's fun I mean every day is totally different Yep and and the crazy thing about appraisals right you can get 10 appraisals to go appraisal same house and everyone there's a very good chance that all 10 are going to come in a different value Very if you don't give a contract and ask them how much it is they will come in with 10 different values because there's no right answer right it's an opinion appraisal is an opinion a big part of that appraiser's job is there's a section where there's that ABC or 123 unconditioned it's his opinion it's his opinion you know you tell me how an appraiser can come in $50,000 less and a different one looks at that same house with nothing done to it coming at the purchase price anything speaking of value so you guys know whenever we do a mortgage and we do a mortgage The mortgage is based off the sales contract or the OR the appraised value the lower of the two so if we have $100,000 sales contract and he did the appraisals it came in at 90 we're going to base the down payment off the 90 you understand not off the hundred so they got to come up with that extra money that's after we all did a second appraisal and all that stuff so it's always off the lesser of the 2 it's not my role it's everyone's role so you know some people build a $1,000,000 house on a $500,000 block Doesn't mean that it's going to come in at a million if the same house is on the block is that you know could you put in extra stuff you know it doesn't mean you're always going to get that value but anyway it's far from few knocked on wood but just so you understand that and that's my job and I'm going to end it at that because I talk a lot so no not really Business No one I might not be the smartest guy here but no one out works us here well not only that I don't think anybody knows as much about mortgages as Pat you know he's been in this field forever and he's sharing that years and years and years of knowledge with you and II that's our goal here too to take you know all the people I have coming in going over Wendy and and Mark going over everything is that we take all these years of experience we have and try to you know offer it to you take take whatever you want of it we'll take all of it but you have that experience for the company you know blogs there's whatever but nobody nobody else does that and that was Christy's idea it was their idea to make sure that if there was a one on one training you know personal training rather and I think I think it works you know according to everything I've researched it works you know having Pat come in it's a big deal get to know him Brokers that you'll be working with on the other side you'll never know them you'll never see their face you don't know who they are they'll never answer their phone yeah so II recommend you We are it was sure flexible and now it seemed to go to 3rd and we still do the right thing and if I can't do it I'm going to tell you no Alexandra can't do it she didn't tell you no doesn't mean no one else can do it but I'm going to be honest with you this is a little arrogant in me If we can't do it no one's doing it because we're asking every possible question to make sure we get the cosigner deal down payment whenever we have to go OK good luck Get your first deal right away it's always good to get your first deal immediately because I always became in threes They do they come in threes always had got one deal in the month next in that month I'd always have great it's crazy I don't know why I think it's because your attitude is portfolio pre-approval process I include Flyers in there and the guys are pretty good at shopping they're pretty strong Awakened with your Bill Ofarrers Wegmans I go there with my bags I got three or 4 folded in my car because I keep forgetting you got to bring your own bags now because we're adding a little bit more there's going to be more door prices every time now if you guys go to excuse me Alexander see what you want If we guys go to show December 8910 whatever it is there's in Atlantic City there's a realtor convention triple play and it's all Realtors from New Jersey Pennsylvania New York a lot of mortgage guys and mortgage companies you go there and get your credits right your CE credits too yeah I don't go there anymore

 Like I'm looking for an investment commercial anything that I can make money and I'll invest I have the money i'm an investor I'm a real estate blah blah blah I like OK can I when do when do you want to call me back or should or give me a time to call you and I alright call me tomorrow According to their work and efficiency says yes one to two yeah and you and you won you asked the worst they could change now and you go to the next one 'cause that one day it might be whatever mood there and I always tell everybody you don't know what happens at home it might be in a mood you know what it is time to sell now and you called that day especially I keep telling you and it's coming snowy days guys pray for snow i'm telling you to make your walls on those days everybody's home Yep and some of the seniors are thinking oh do we have to go through another winter when we could be in Florida or the Carolinas Marie Correa she was looking at a townhouse like about A million 2 I guess she had she got turned off with all the over bidding I'm guessing and then she said oh me and my husband decided that we're moving down south away from the cold I like III have a conversation for her about that You know I'm like I told her listen that's not a problem I got I got friends out there agents out there I could refer you to but you know let's talk so much call me later after 5 when I'm going from work OK when you when when you try not to use the word refer just you know some words are really important i've got friends there and I wouldn't say friends I have colleagues I have agents there that can help you all right because once referred sounds like oh you're trying to just make money on her you know if she gets it right right Just you're just going to say look I've I have agents I've worked with before or agents I can or colleagues that use words like agents colleagues you know part of a team you know if it's a Christie's group down there whatever and and then get her and does she have a house to sell oh OK but you get a referral fee that was good i'm going to call her back I called her yesterday after work I'll give her a call later today and then if she really did want to originally buy here but got I guess she kept losing houses because of the bidding Let's slow it up a bit you could tell her sure it is it's surprising how like a lot of these houses II was looking through the list of and this is from like the summertime back so I'm calling these people and I'm and before I call I'm checking the houses that they were interested in and I see how much they over these people they listed at a million and sold for 1,000,000 4 yeah that's crazy that's ridiculous that's crazy it's what it is it's the market Yeah it did we're the stock market would you say it's crazy no right that'll be good it's it's it's the market supply them in there's no supply that's what it comes out to what do you think people are building more condos for right right because that's the only way we can hopefully have enough people to buy homes and and I really do think because I can talk about condos that'll change soon too because it you know if you own the condo say four or 500,000 right most likely that client tells 510 15% right now if it doesn't make online so it's not on that list you can't do it that way So you just kill the customer unless they're point 20% down so things have got to change because that first time home buyer now up here what is the average first time home buyer forget condos 800,000 for a home up here 78 yeah think about that You still need work to listen I was at a French yesterday i'm doing a construction role he built his own house in Paramus it was a double lot colorado 77 Colorado he's building a house there they're building something like that around the corner And Paramus which is beautiful people love Paramus education and taxes around the corner 2.8 And I wouldn't even beautiful house 4500 square feet the land besides on land it was so ugly but he'll sell it like this because it's Paramus New Jersey right crazy call me usually all you got I don't care if the question i'm not going to waste this time because it's Saturday at 4:00 If I can't do it until you can't do it if it's a question they pat I need your help with this i'm always on the phone if I can't do it this young lady it's funny our conversations on Friday because she has her kids are younger than mom alexandra where's your son playing soccer today and what days right and she's at the soccer field just just so we know to coordinate where we're going to be and then because if she's on a soccer field I soccer field and you call me hey we're both on the soccer field hey I'll call your customer now we'll get the information but I'll let you know tonight And it's pretty good and he does I do i've been doing real estate since I was very young very young but it's over 40 years and II the battle with mortgage brokers you know you couldn't get them you couldn't talk to them they take the deal you never heard from them it was a nightmare this is wonderful this is wonderful as much as I can listen I think it's going back to old school they want their handheld People like service there you go you're going to get one or two that's better And talk to people I hate texting I hate texting I hate my cell phone I hate my cell phone but it is when it's just the world we live in but don't be afraid to go see him don't be afraid to take him out twice if they don't put in an offer I think texting should be just for like just confirming an appointment with or just simply you know you don't you don't negotiate on on here at all ever you can't all right guys have a great'

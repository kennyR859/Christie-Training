## Overview

Unity Bank's creative collateral and LLC loan strategies provide solutions that traditional lenders cannot offer. Understanding these options helps agents close deals with complex financing needs, particularly for customers with multiple properties or business entities.

---

## Creative Collateral Solutions

### Using Existing Properties as Collateral

**Scenario:** Customer buying new home but short on liquid cash

**Traditional Approach:**
- Must liquidate investments
- Sell stocks at potential loss
- Tap retirement accounts (penalties)
- Delay purchase until funds available

**Unity's Solution:**
- Use equity from OTHER property as collateral
- Keep investments intact
- Maintain retirement accounts
- Close on timeline

**Example:**
```
Customer Profile:
- Buying: $600,000 home (needs 20% down = $120,000)
- Liquid Cash: Only $50,000 available
- Investment Property: Worth $400,000, free and clear

Unity Solution:
- Put lien on investment property for additional collateral
- Customer puts down $50,000 cash
- Investment property equity covers remaining down payment requirement
- Customer keeps other investments intact
- Closes on new home
```

## Cross-Collateralization Strategy

### When Multiple Properties Are Involved

**Unity's Flexibility:**
- Can use Property A as collateral for Property B loan
- Can combine equity from multiple properties
- Allows customer to preserve liquidity
- Maintains investment portfolio intact

**Traditional Lender:**
- Each property standalone
- Cannot cross-collateralize
- Must have cash or sell assets
- Rigid underwriting requirements

**Best Use Cases:**
1. Customer buying while keeping rental properties
2. Investment portfolio expansion
3. Estate planning and wealth preservation
4. Business owners with multiple properties

## LLC Loan Treatment

### Unity's Unique Approach

**Key Difference:**
Unity treats LLC loans as **residential loans**, NOT commercial loans

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No prepayment penalty** (residential loan treatment)
- ✅ Lower interest rates than commercial
- ✅ Longer amortization (30 years)
- ✅ Better terms overall

**Traditional Lenders:**
- Treat LLC as commercial loan
- 3-5 year prepayment penalties
- Higher interest rates
- Shorter amortization (15-20 years)
- Stricter requirements

---

## LLC Loan Details

### When Customers Use LLCs

**Common Scenarios:**
- Investment properties
- Asset protection strategy
- Tax planning purposes
- Estate planning
- Business structure requirements

**Unity's Treatment:**
```
Traditional Lender:
Property in LLC → Commercial loan
- Rate: 7-8%
- Prepayment penalty: 3-5 years
- Term: 15-20 years
- Fees: 1-2 points

Unity Bank:
Property in LLC → Residential portfolio loan
- Rate: Market rate + 0.5-1% (6.5-7%)
- Prepayment penalty: NONE
- Term: 30 years
- Fees: 1 point
```

### Fee Structure

**Residential Owner-Occupied:**
- NO points
- Standard fees only

**LLC Loans:**
- 1 point (1% of loan amount)
- Standard fees

**Example:**
```
$500,000 LLC loan:
- 1 point = $5,000
- Still better than commercial loan with prepayment penalty

Commercial Alternative:
- 2 points = $10,000
- PLUS 3-year prepayment penalty
- Could cost $15,000-$30,000 if refinance or sell early
```

---

## Why No Prepayment Penalty Matters

### Real-World Impact

**Scenario 1: Market Rates Drop**
```
Year 1: Customer gets LLC loan at 7%
Year 2: Rates drop to 5.5%

Unity:
- Refinance anytime with no penalty
- Save $200-300/month immediately
- No additional cost to refinance

Traditional Commercial:
- 3-year prepayment penalty
- Cost: $15,000-$25,000 to refinance
- Must wait or pay penalty
```

**Scenario 2: Property Sale**
```
Customer needs to sell investment property in Year 2

Unity:
- Sell anytime, no penalty
- Clean transaction

Traditional Commercial:
- Prepayment penalty: $20,000-$30,000
- Reduces profit significantly
- Limits flexibility
```

**Scenario 3: Refinance to Pull Cash**
```
Property appreciates significantly, customer wants to access equity

Unity:
- Refinance anytime to pull cash out
- No penalty
- Maintain flexibility

Traditional Commercial:
- Locked in for 3-5 years
- Penalty to access own equity
- Opportunity cost significant
```

## Asset Protection Through LLCs

### Why Investors Use LLCs

**Legal Protection:**
- Separates personal assets from property liability
- Limits exposure if lawsuit on property
- Professional asset protection strategy

**Unity's Advantage:**
- Doesn't penalize customers for using smart legal structure
- Treats as residential loan (better terms)
- Recognizes legitimate business structure

**Pat's Perspective:**
> "Some lenders treat LLC like you're doing something wrong. We recognize it's smart asset protection. We don't punish customers for protecting themselves legally."

---

## When to Suggest Creative Collateral

### Red Flags for Need

**Customer Situations:**
- "I have the money but it's tied up in investments"
- "I own other properties but low on liquid cash"
- "I don't want to liquidate my portfolio right now"
- "Can I use my rental property somehow?"
- "I have a business/LLC structure"

**Property Situations:**
- Investment property purchase
- Customer has multiple properties
- Asset protection important
- Tax strategy considerations

---

## How to Present to Customers

### Explaining Cross-Collateralization

**Agent Script:**
> "Unity Bank has a unique solution for your situation. Instead of liquidating your investments or selling stocks at a loss, we can use the equity in your rental property as additional collateral. You keep all your investments intact, maintain your portfolio, and still close on this home. Would you like me to introduce you to Pat to discuss the details?"

### Explaining LLC Loan Benefits

**Agent Script:**
> "I understand you want to buy this property in an LLC for asset protection. Most lenders will treat that as a commercial loan with higher rates, shorter terms, and prepayment penalties. Unity Bank treats LLC loans as residential loans - no prepayment penalty, 30-year term, and competitive rates. It's one of their unique advantages that saves investors significant money."

---

## Agent Strategies

### Identifying Opportunities

**Questions to Ask:**
1. "How many properties do you currently own?"
2. "Do you have equity in other properties?"
3. "Are you planning to hold in personal name or LLC?"
4. "What's your exit strategy timeline?"
5. "How important is flexibility for refinancing?"

**Listen For:**
- Multiple property ownership
- Investment strategy
- Asset protection concerns
- Liquidity constraints
- Business structure mentions

### Positioning Unity's Advantage

**To Investors:**
> "Unity Bank is unique in treating LLC loans as residential with no prepayment penalties. This saves investors like you tens of thousands of dollars in flexibility and better terms. Let me connect you with Pat to discuss how this works for your portfolio."

**To Liquidity-Constrained Buyers:**
> "You mentioned you have equity in your other property but not a lot of liquid cash right now. Unity has creative collateral solutions that let you use that equity without selling or liquidating investments. Would you like to explore this option?"

## Important Disclosures

### Risks and Considerations

- Doesn't understand the liens and risks
- Better alternatives available (cash-out refinance of collateral property instead)

---

## Comparison to Alternatives

### Cross-Collateral vs Cash-Out Refinance

**Cross-Collateral:**
- Keeps existing mortgage intact
- Adds lien to property
- No closing costs on existing property
- Faster process

**Cash-Out Refinance:**
- Refinances existing property
- Gets cash for down payment on new purchase
- One mortgage on existing property
- May take longer

**Best Choice:**
Depends on existing mortgage rate, timeline, and long-term plans

### LLC Loan vs Personal Name

**LLC Loan (Unity):**
- Asset protection benefit
- 1 point fee
- Market rate + 0.5-1%
- No prepayment penalty
- 30-year term

**Personal Name:**
- No asset protection
- No points (if owner-occupied)
- Market rate
- No prepayment penalty
- 30-year term

**Difference:**
1 point fee (~$5,000 on $500K loan) for significant legal protection

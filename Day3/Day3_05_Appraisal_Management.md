## Why Appraisal Matters

### The Appraisal's Purpose

**For the lender:**
- Confirms property value supports loan amount
- Protects bank's investment
- Required for nearly all mortgages
- Determines maximum loan amount

**For the buyer:**
- Protects against overpaying
- Appraisal contingency allows exit if value low
- Can use low appraisal to renegotiate price

**For the seller:**
- Can derail sale if comes in low
- May need to reduce price
- May need to wait for cash buyer

### When Appraisal Becomes Critical

**Situations requiring extra attention:**

1. **Offer over asking price**
   - Multiple offers drove price up
   - Must justify to appraiser
   - Need strong comps

2. **Competitive market**
   - Homes routinely selling over asking
   - Need market analysis to support
   - Show appraiser the trend

3. **Unique property**
   - Fewer comparable sales
   - Special features or upgrades
   - Requires extra documentation

4. **Weak lender with out-of-area appraiser**
   - Appraiser doesn't know local market
   - May miss neighborhood nuances
   - Your education becomes critical

## When Appraiser Contacts You

### The Call

**Appraiser will reach out:**
- Usually 7-14 days after loan application
- May call listing agent or buyer's agent
- Wants to schedule property inspection

**Your response:**
- Return call immediately (within 1 hour if possible)
- Be friendly and professional
- Schedule ASAP
- Confirm you'll attend

**Script:**
> "Thanks for calling. I'm the buyer's agent and I'd like to attend the appraisal. When works for you? I can be flexible to accommodate your schedule."

**Coordinate with:**
- Appraiser's schedule
- Seller's availability
- Listing agent if property occupied
- Your schedule (make this a priority)

## Preparing for the Appraisal

### Research Comparable Sales

**What makes a good comp:**

1. **Location**
   - Same neighborhood (ideal)
   - Within 1 mile maximum
   - Same school district
   - Same side of major dividing features

2. **Size**
   - Within 10-15% of subject property square footage
   - Same number of bedrooms (or very close)
   - Similar lot size
   - Same number of bathrooms (within 1)

3. **Age and condition**
   - Built within 10 years of subject
   - Similar condition
   - Similar upgrade level

4. **Sale date**
   - Last 3-6 months (ideal)
   - Up to 12 months if necessary
   - More recent = more weight

5. **Sale price**
   - At or above your purchase price (ideal)
   - Show market supports your price
   - Include some slightly lower if market rising

### The Ridgewood Example

**Critical local knowledge:**
> "Ridgewood has different sections with HUGE price differences for same house:"

- **Lawn Section:** Premium pricing
- **Heights Section:** Different pricing tier
- **Other side of Route 17:** Significantly different pricing

**Out-of-area appraiser problem:**
- Doesn't know these distinctions
- May use comps from wrong section
- Undervalues property

**Your job:**
- Educate appraiser on local nuances
- Provide comps from CORRECT section
- Explain micro-market differences

### Gathering Your Comps Package

**Minimum: 3-5 comparable sales**

**Where to find comps:**
- MLS (your primary source)
- Public records
- Recent closings in neighborhood
- Ask listing agent for comps they used

**What to include for each comp:**
- Property photo
- Address
- Sale price and date
- Square footage
- Lot size
- Bedrooms/bathrooms
- Brief description of similarities
- MLS printout if possible

**Organize professionally:**
- Printed packet in folder or stapled
- Clear, readable format
- Highlight key similarities
- Include map showing locations

---

## What to Bring to Appraisal

### Your Comps Package

**3-5 comparable sales** (as detailed above)

### Market Analysis

**Show market conditions:**
- Average days on market
- List price to sale price ratio
- Number of homes selling over asking
- Inventory levels
- Recent market trends

**Print from MLS or prepare document showing:**
> "In [Neighborhood] over the last 3 months:
> - 87% of homes sold over asking price
> - Average over-ask: 5%
> - Average days on market: 8 days
> - Multiple offer situations standard"

### Property Improvement Documentation

**If seller provided:**
- Recent renovations with costs
- New roof (age and cost)
- New HVAC system (age and cost)
- Kitchen/bathroom updates
- Finished basement details
- Any major improvements

**Why this matters:**
- Appraiser may not see upgrades as "new"
- Knowing costs helps appraiser add value
- Shows property better than standard comps

### Multiple Offer Documentation (if applicable)

**If property had multiple offers:**
- Print listing history showing offer deadline
- If listing agent willing: Letter confirming multiple offers
- Market explanation

**Script for appraiser:**
> "This property received 17 offers. The competitive bidding drove the price to this level. This is consistent with the current market. Here are other properties in the area where the same thing occurred."

## At the Appraisal Appointment

### Arrival and Introduction

**Be early:**
- Arrive 5 minutes before appraiser
- Unlock property if needed
- Turn on lights
- Open blinds/curtains for good presentation

**Professional introduction:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name] from Christie's International Real Estate. I'm the buyer's agent. I appreciate you letting me attend. I brought some comps and market information that might be helpful."

**Gauge appraiser's receptiveness:**
- Some appraisers welcome your input
- Some prefer to work independently
- Read the situation
- Adapt accordingly

### During the Inspection

**Let appraiser work:**
- Don't hover
- Don't interrupt measurements
- Don't be pushy
- Be available for questions

**When appraiser asks questions:**
- Answer honestly and accurately
- Provide supporting documentation
- Don't exaggerate or misrepresent

**Appropriate to mention:**
- Recent upgrades ("The HVAC was replaced 2 years ago")
- Special features ("This is an extra-large lot for the neighborhood")
- Market conditions ("Properties in this section command premium pricing")

**NOT appropriate to say:**
- "You better make this appraise or the deal dies"
- "I need you to hit this number"
- "Can you use these specific comps and ignore others?"
- Anything that sounds like pressure or manipulation

### Providing Your Comps

**When to offer:**
- Wait for natural break in inspection
- Or at end of walk-through
- Don't force it

**How to present:**
> "I pulled some recent comparable sales that show the market strength in this area. Would you like a copy? I know you'll do your own research, but I thought these might be helpful."

**Appraiser will likely:**
- Accept the package
- Thank you
- May or may not use your comps
- Will do independent research regardless

**Remember:**
- You're providing information, not demanding specific result
- Professional, helpful approach
- Let appraiser make independent decision

## Explaining Competitive Market

### When Price is Over Asking

**The conversation:**

**Appraiser:** "I see the purchase price is significantly over the list price."

**Your response:**
> "Yes, the market is extremely competitive right now. This property had 17 offers and we had to go above asking to secure it. Here's another recent sale in the neighborhood where the same thing happened [show comp]. Buyers are regularly paying above asking prices in this area."

**Supporting evidence:**
- Multiple sales over asking
- Low inventory
- High demand
- Quick sale times
- Bidding wars becoming standard

### Market Data to Share

**Prepare statistics:**
- "In this zip code, 75% of homes sold over asking last month"
- "Average days on market: 6 days"
- "This property had multiple showings within 48 hours of listing"
- "There are only 4 comparable homes currently available in this school district"

**Why this helps:**
- Gives appraiser context
- Explains price premium
- Shows your price isn't anomaly
- Demonstrates market justification

---

## Appraiser May Call Listing Agents

### Facilitating This Communication

**What happens:**
- Appraiser researches comps
- Calls listing agents to verify sale details
- Asks about circumstances (multiple offers, condition, etc.)

**Your role:**
- You can suggest appraiser call listing agent of comp sale
- Provide contact info if you have it
- Most listing agents will cooperate

**What listing agents typically confirm:**
- Sale price accurate
- Multiple offer situation
- Property condition
- Any unusual circumstances
- Justification for price

**This helps your case:**
- Verifies market conditions
- Confirms over-asking prices are real
- Shows pattern, not anomaly
- Strengthens appraisal support

---

## After the Appraisal

### Follow-Up

**With appraiser:**
- Thank them for their time
- Provide business card
- Offer to answer any follow-up questions

**Don't ask:**
- "What do you think it will appraise for?"
- "Will it hit our purchase price?"
- "When will the report be done?"

**These questions are for mortgage broker, not appraiser**

### With Mortgage Broker

**Call same day or next day:**
> "Hi [Broker], the appraisal was completed yesterday. When do you expect to receive the report? Is there anything else needed from my buyer?"

**Document:**
- Date of appraisal
- Appraiser name
- Expected report date
- Any concerns or issues noted

---

## If Appraisal Comes in Low

### Immediate Steps

**1. Get the full appraisal report**
- Request from mortgage broker
- Review in detail
- Look for errors or questionable comps

**2. Review for accuracy**

**Common errors:**
- Wrong square footage
- Missed upgrades or renovations
- Incorrect bedroom/bathroom count
- Used comps from different neighborhood section
- Used old comps when newer ones available
- Didn't account for market conditions

**3. Prepare rebuttal (if warranted)**

**Grounds for challenging:**
- Factual errors in property details
- Inappropriate comps used
- Failed to consider recent comparable sales
- Didn't account for special features
- Out-of-area appraiser missed local factors

**How to challenge:**
- Through mortgage broker (not directly to appraiser)
- Provide specific errors with documentation
- Submit additional comps
- Professional, factual tone
- Some appraisers will revise

**4. Negotiate with seller**

**Options:**
- Seller reduces price to appraisal amount
- Buyer makes up difference with additional cash
- Meet in middle
- Walk away (appraisal contingency protects buyer)

### Sample Negotiation Conversation

**With listing agent:**
> "Hi [Listing Agent], we received the appraisal and it came in at $480K, which is $20K below our agreed price of $500K. My buyers love the property but are at their maximum budget. Would your seller consider reducing the price to the appraised value? Or perhaps meeting us halfway at $490K?"

**Be prepared for:**
- Seller refusing to budge (they can try to find cash buyer)
- Seller countering somewhere in middle
- Seller requesting buyer make up difference
- Seller agreeing to appraised value (if motivated)

## Choosing the Right Lender Matters

### Unity Bank (Instructor's Recommendation)

**Advantages:**
- Uses local appraisers
- Appraisers know market nuances
- Understand neighborhood variations
- Responsive communication
- Fast processing

**Local knowledge example:**
> "Unity Bank appraisers know Ridgewood Lawn Section vs Heights Section vs other side of Route 17. They understand the price differences for same house."

**Additional benefits:**
- Portfolio loans (for self-employed)
- Conventional, FHA, VA
- Fast turnaround
- Broker works with you, not against you

**Success story:**
> "Closed million-dollar deal in 2 weeks when another bank failed. Unity Bank came through fast."

### Rocket Mortgage & Online Lenders (Avoid)

**Problems:**
- Appraisers assigned from appraisal management company
- May be from out of area
- Don't know local market
- Miss neighborhood nuances
- May undervalue properties

**Example scenario:**
- Online lender orders appraisal
- Appraiser comes from 50 miles away
- Uses comps from wrong neighborhood section
- Doesn't understand local premium for certain streets
- Appraisal comes in low
- Deal dies or requires renegotiation

**Your recommendation to buyers:**
> "I strongly suggest using a local lender like Unity Bank. They use appraisers who understand our market, which reduces the risk of appraisal issues. Online lenders often assign out-of-area appraisers who don't know the local nuances."

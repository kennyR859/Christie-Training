## Regency Title: Christie's Partner

### Special Benefits for Christie's Agents

**Instructor's endorsement:**
> "Regency Title is our title company. They give us special benefits that make deals easier."

---

### Benefit #1: Pre-Commitment Title Search (FREE)

**What it is:**
- Run title search BEFORE deal is finalized
- Identifies problems early
- No charge if deal fails

**When to use:**
- Buyer asking about potential liens
- Seller unsure if title is clear
- Property has complicated ownership history
- Short sale or foreclosure situations

**How it helps:**

**Example scenario:**
- Taking listing
- Seller says "I think there might be an old lien"
- Call Regency: "Can you run preliminary title search?"
- Regency finds: Previous mortgage + contractor lien + HOA lien
- Total: Seller owes $550K, property worth $500K
- **Seller is "underwater"**

**Now you know:**
- Need short sale, not regular sale
- Can strategize with seller
- Don't waste time marketing property wrong way
- Discovered BEFORE listing, not during contract

---

### Benefit #2: Flood Zone Verification (FREE)

**The problem:**
- Property on border of flood zone
- Maps unclear
- FEMA maps sometimes inaccurate
- Makes huge difference in insurance costs

**What Regency does:**
- Precise survey analysis
- Determines if property actually IN flood zone
- If in flood zone, which zone level (A, B, C, etc.)
- Provides written determination

**Why this matters:**

**Flood insurance costs:**
- **Not in flood zone:** No flood insurance required
- **In Flood Zone C:** Minimal flood insurance
- **In Flood Zone A:** Expensive flood insurance ($2,000-$5,000/year)

**Deal impact:**
- Buyer may walk away if expensive flood insurance required
- Seller may not know property in flood zone
- Can derail deal at last minute
- Better to know upfront

**Regency benefit:**

### Benefit #3: No Charge if Deal Fails

**Standard title company:**
- You order title work

**Regency Title:**

- Only pay if deal closes
- Removes financial risk

**Strategic advantage:**

**Normal timeline:**
1. Attorney review (3 days)
2. Inspection period (10-14 days)
3. Mortgage commitment (30 days)
4. **THEN order title work** (because don't want to pay if deal dies)
5. Title work takes 2-3 weeks
6. Closing delayed

**With Regency:**
1. Attorney review (3 days)
2. **Order title work immediately**
3. Inspection period (while title work in progress)
4. Mortgage commitment (while title work in progress)
5. Title work done, ready to close

## Types of Title Insurance

### Owner's Policy

**Protects buyer:**
- Coverage equals purchase price
- Protects buyer's equity
- Lasts as long as buyer owns property
- One-time premium at closing

**Typical cost:**
- Based on purchase price
- Example: $500K home = approximately $1,500-$2,500
- Varies by state and title company

### Lender's Policy

**Protects bank:**
- Required by lender for any mortgage
- Coverage equals loan amount
- Protects bank's interest only
- Decreases as mortgage paid down
- Buyer pays for this at closing

**Why buyer pays:**
- Lender requires it
- Protects lender, not buyer
- Separate from owner's policy
- Usually less expensive than owner's policy

**Both policies usually purchased at closing**

## Explaining Title Insurance to Clients

### To Buyers

**Why they need it:**
> "Title insurance protects your ownership. If someone appears with a claim against your property from before you bought it - an old lien, a forged document, a boundary dispute - your title insurance covers the legal defense and any costs. It's a one-time fee that protects you forever."

**Cost context:**
> "It typically costs about 0.3-0.5% of the purchase price. For a $500,000 home, around $1,500-$2,500. That's a small price to pay for protecting your entire investment."

### To Sellers

**Why title must be clear:**
> "Before we can close, we need to ensure you can deliver 'clear title' to the buyer. The title company will search for any liens, unpaid judgments, or other claims. If they find anything, we'll need to resolve it before closing. This is standard and protects both you and the buyer."

**Common issues:**
> "Sometimes old mortgages weren't properly released, or there's a small lien you forgot about. The title company will identify these, and your attorney can help resolve them quickly."

### Week 2: Appraisal

**What happens:**

**What to bring to appraisal:**

1. **Comparable sales (3-5 minimum)**
   - Similar size, age, condition
   - Same neighborhood if possible
   - Sold within last 3-6 months

   - Demonstrate competitive market
   - Print from MLS

3. **Property improvements list**
   - Recent renovations
   - Upgraded systems (HVAC, roof, etc.)

**Appraiser may call listing agents of comps:**
- You can facilitate this
- Ask listing agent of comp sale to speak with appraiser

## Lender Selection Matters

### Recommended: Unity Bank

**Why instructor recommends:**
- Knows local market
- Uses quality local appraisers
- Fast processing
- Portfolio loans available
- Responsive communication

**Appraisal advantage:**
> "Appraisers know local market nuances. Example: Ridgewood Lawn Section vs Heights Section vs other side of Route 17 - HUGE price differences for same house."

**Portfolio loans:**
- For self-employed borrowers
- High assets, lower documented income
- Don't need to sell loans to Fannie/Freddie
- More flexibility

**Success story:**
> "Closed million-dollar deal in 2 weeks when another bank failed. Unity Bank came through fast."

---

### Avoid: Rocket Mortgage & Random Online Lenders

**Problems:**
- Appraisers come from anywhere (not local)
- Don't understand local market
- May undervalue in competitive areas
- Customer service issues
- Delays in communication

**Ridgewood example:**
- Lawn Section homes: Premium pricing
- Heights Section homes: Different pricing
- Other side of Route 17: Significantly different pricing
- **Out-of-area appraiser doesn't know this**

**Result:**
- Appraisal comes in low
- Deal dies or needs renegotiation
- Everyone's time wasted

---

## If Appraisal Comes in Low

### Immediate Steps

**1. Review appraisal report**
- Check comps used
- Verify property details accurate
- Look for errors or omissions

**2. Challenge if warranted**
- Provide additional comps
- Point out errors
- Submit rebuttal through mortgage broker
- Some appraisers will revise

**3. Negotiate with seller**
- Explain situation
- Request price reduction to appraisal amount
- Seller may counter somewhere in middle

**4. Buyer makes up difference**
- If buyer has extra cash
- Bring more money to closing
- Increases down payment
- Reduces loan amount

**5. Walk away**
- If appraisal vastly different
- Buyer can't or won't make up difference
- Seller won't reduce price
- Appraisal contingency protects buyer

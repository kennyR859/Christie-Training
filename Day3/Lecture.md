# Day 3 - Real Estate Agent Training Lecture

## Overview
Day 3 focuses on advanced contract writing, confidentiality rules, escalation clauses, mortgage processes, appraisal management, title insurance, seller's concessions, timeline management, transfer taxes, short sales, FSBO strategies, and client communication techniques.

---

## Part 1: Agency & Confidentiality (Fern)

### Confidentiality Obligations

#### What You MUST Disclose
**Things of substance:**
- Mechanical issues (HVAC, plumbing, electrical)
- Structural problems (foundation, roof, walls)
- Environmental concerns (mold, lead, radon)
- Any defects affecting property value or safety

#### What You CANNOT Disclose

**Buyer's confidential information:**
- "We'll offer $500K but can go to $550K if needed"
- Buyer is getting divorced
- Buyer inherited $2 million
- Buyer's financial distress/motivation
- Personal family situations

**Seller's confidential information:**
- Seller must sell fast (foreclosure, job transfer)
- Seller's financial situation
- Seller's bottom line
- Personal circumstances causing sale

#### The Gray Area: Escalation Clauses

**What is an escalation clause?**
> "I will pay $X more than any other offer" or "I will pay up to $20,000 more than the highest offer"

**The problem:**
- Listing agent must show buyer the competing contract
- Breaches confidentiality of other offers
- All offers should be confidential

**Current legal status:**
- Still legal (for now)
- MLS once banned it, then allowed it again
- Many listing agents refuse escalation clauses
- Likely to become court case soon

**Recommendation:**
> Steer away from escalation clauses. If buyer insists, prepare for listing agent to reject it or demand full contract disclosure.

## Part 2: Contract Writing Line-by-Line

### Critical Contract Lines

#### Initial Deposit vs. Additional Deposit

**Line 43: Purchase Price**
- Total offering price
- Auto-fills from earlier entry

**Line 45: Initial Deposit**
> **CROSS THIS OUT** - Not used anymore

**Why we don't use initial deposit:**
- Law requires deposit within 24 hours if taken
- Would need to deposit, then withdraw for renegotiation
- Creates unnecessary complications
- Skip and go to Line 46

**Line 46: Additional Deposit**
- This is your REAL first deposit
- Traditionally 10% of purchase price
- Can be less for FHA/VA (3%)
- Can be more for stronger offer

**Line 48: Balance of Purchase Price**
- Remaining down payment beyond Line 46
- Example: 20% down total
  - 10% on Line 46 (additional deposit)
  - 10% on Line 48 (balance)

**Line 51: Manner of Payment**
> **CROSS THIS OUT** - Not used

---

### Deposit Details

**Line 56: When Additional Deposit is Due**
- Default: Within 10 business days after fully signed contract
- **Better:** Within 1 day after attorney review
- **Best:** Available within 1 day after attorney review

**Who holds it:**
- Escrow account of seller's attorney
- Interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing account

**Making offer stronger:**
> In additional contractual provisions (Line 721), add:
> "BUYER WILL DEPOSIT 10% IMMEDIATELY AFTER ATTORNEY REVIEW IS COMPLETED"

---

### Mortgage Details

**Line 60-66: Mortgage Contingency**
If buyer needs mortgage, this section is critical

**Key elements:**
- Principal amount (how much borrowing)
- Type of mortgage (FHA, VA, 203K, Conventional, Assumable)
- Term (usually 30 years)
- Monthly payments based on what term

**203K Loan:**
- "Buy it, fix it" mortgage
- Bank lends for purchase + repairs
- Requires inspections at each stage
- Town inspector + bank inspector must coordinate
- Time-consuming but valuable for buyers without repair funds

**Assumable Mortgages:**
- Rare but exist
- Usually old VA loans with low rates
- Problem: Rate so low it doesn't help (need 2nd mortgage at high rate)
- Not common in current market

---

### Mortgage Timeline

**Line 78: Mortgage Commitment Date**
- Usually 30 days from attorney review
- All paperwork to bank
- Credit check completed
- Appraisal ordered and completed
- Underwriting review
- Commitment letter issued

**YOUR CRITICAL JOB:**
> Put all timeline dates in your phone calendar with reminders!

**Follow-up sequence:**
1. **Week 1:** Confirm buyer applied for mortgage
2. **Week 2:** Check if appraiser scheduled
3. **Week 3:** Confirm appraisal completed, in underwriting
4. **Week 4:** Obtain commitment letter

**If running late:**
- Call attorney IMMEDIATELY
- Request extension in writing
- Notify seller's attorney
- Avoid deal falling through

**Warning:**
> "If you don't meet mortgage commitment date, deal is dead in water. Seller can walk away. If there's backup offer, they might take it."

---

### Meeting the Appraiser

**When appraiser contacts you:**
- ALWAYS meet them at property
- Bring comparable sales (comps)
- Explain market conditions

**Critical if over asking:**
> "This house had 17 offers and went way over asking. Here's another house where the same thing happened at this price."

**Appraiser may call listing agents:**
- You can ask listing agent of comp sale to speak with appraiser
- Most will confirm sale price and circumstances
- Helps justify your higher price

**Bank Warning:**
> Avoid Rocket Mortgage and random online lenders

**Why:**
- Appraisers come from anywhere
- Don't know local market nuances
- Example: Ridgewood Lawn Section vs Heights Section vs. other side of Route 17 - HUGE price differences for same house

**Recommended:**
> Unity Bank - knows local market, uses quality appraisers, fast processing

**Unity Bank also offers:**
- Portfolio loans (for self-employed with assets but low documented income)
- Conventional, FHA, VA
- Fast turnaround (closed million-dollar deal in 2 weeks when other bank failed)

---

## Part 3: Title Company & Insurance

### What is Title Insurance?

**Purpose:**
- Ensures you own the property free and clear
- Protects against past claims
- Covers legal defense if ownership challenged

**What it covers:**
- False impersonation
- Undisclosed errors
- Tampering
- Legal defense costs
- Previous liens not found in search

### Regency Title (Christie's Partner)

**Special Benefits for Christie's Agents:**

1. **Pre-commitment title search** (FREE)
   - Run before deal closes
   - Confirms no liens/problems
   - Helps if seller is "underwater"

2. **Flood zone verification** (FREE)
   - When property is on border of flood zone
   - Clarifies if actually in flood zone
   - Determines which flood zone level

3. **No charge if deal fails**
   - Normal: Title work costs $$$ if deal dies
   - Regency: If deal fails during inspection/mortgage, NO CHARGE
   - Allows expedited closing process

**Normal timeline:**
- Attorney review → Mortgage commitment → THEN order title work

**With Regency:**
- Attorney review → Order title immediately
- Faster closing
- Buyer protected even if deal falls through

---

### Short Sales

**What is a short sale?**
- Seller owes more than property worth
- Example: Owes $600K (includes penalties), house worth $550K
- Bank agrees to accept less than owed
- Avoids foreclosure

**When to use:**
- Seller facing foreclosure
- Can't afford to pay all mortgages/liens/penalties
- Would otherwise lose everything

**Process:**
1. Call seller's bank
2. Explain situation (job loss, illness, etc.)
3. Request penalty reduction
4. Negotiate lower payoff
5. Attorney handles most negotiations
6. Usually takes 6 months

**Bank motivation:**
- Foreclosure is expensive
- Legally complex
- Time-consuming
- Rather accept short sale

**Result:**
- Seller may get SOME money (rare)
- At minimum: Pays Realtors, attorneys, transfer taxes
- Seller avoids foreclosure on record
- Everyone gets paid

---

## Part 4: Seller's Concession Strategy

### What is Seller's Concession?

**Definition:**
- Seller gives buyer credit at closing
- Buyer uses credit for closing costs
- Allows buyer to put more money down

**Bank rules:**
- WILL allow: Seller credit for closing costs
- WILL NOT allow: Seller credit for repairs (inspection items)

### The Strategy (Critical for FHA/VA Buyers)

**Problem:**
- FHA buyer needs only 3% down
- But buyer also needs money for closing costs
- Buyer has exactly enough for 3% + closing, nothing more
- Needs to convert to conventional (requires 10% down)

**Solution:**
- Raise purchase price by $10,000
- Seller gives $10,000 credit for closing costs
- Buyer uses their closing cost money for down payment instead
- Now has 10% down (conventional loan)

**Example:**
- House price: $300,000
- New price: $310,000
- Seller credit: $10,000
- Buyer's closing cost money → goes to down payment
- Seller gets same net ($300K)
- Buyer gets conventional loan with 10% down

**Will it appraise?**
> "When appraiser sees seller giving back closing costs, question is: What are they really selling it for?"
>
> In hot market with homes going over asking, usually not a problem.

**Requires cooperation:**
- Buyer's agent understands the math
- Seller's agent explains benefit to seller
- Everyone agrees to structure

**Quote:**
> "Many listing agents don't even think of this. They're not trained. You have to almost educate your listing agent."

## Part 5: Critical Timeline Management

### Dates That MUST Be Tracked

1. **Additional Deposit Due** (usually 10 days, make it 1 day)
2. **Attorney Review Period** (3 business days)
3. **Mortgage Application** (within 10 days, make it immediate)
4. **Home Inspection** (coordinate ASAP)
5. **Mortgage Commitment** (30-45 days)
6. **Closing Date**

### Your Follow-Up Duties

**Additional Deposit:**
- Remind buyer when due
- **Follow up with attorney:** "Did you receive the 10%?"
- Don't assume anyone else is tracking

**Real story:**
> "New agent reminded buyer to deliver 10%. Wife said husband would do it tomorrow. Agent never checked again. At closing, 10% was never delivered. Had to run out and get it. Very embarrassing."

**Lesson:** Two to three checkpoints for every deadline
1. Remind client
2. Confirm client did it
3. Confirm receiving party got it

**Mortgage Process:**
- Week 1: Applied?
- Week 2: Appraiser scheduled?
- Week 3: Appraisal done? In underwriting?
- Week 4: Any missing paperwork?
- Week 5: Commitment letter?

**Call mortgage broker weekly:**
> "Where are we? Underwriting? Any questions? All papers in?"

**If Problem Arises:**
1. Call listing agent immediately
2. Explain situation
3. Request extension
4. Have attorney send amendment extending date
5. Calm seller (they're panicking if they bought another house)

## Part 6: Transfer Taxes & Millionaire's Tax

### New Jersey Transfer Fee Schedule

**Under $350,000:**
- Base fee calculation

**$350,000 - $550,000:**
- Higher percentage

**$550,000 - $850,000:**
- Increased rate

**$850,000 - $1 Million:**
- Another tier

**Millionaire's Tax (CHANGED RECENTLY):**

**Old rule:**
- Buyer paid 1% on any home over $1 million

**New rule (Seller pays on sliding scale):**
- $1M - $2M: Different rate
- $2M - $2.5M: Higher rate
- $2.5M - $3M: Higher still
- $3M - $3.5M: 3% consideration
- Over $3.5M: 3% consideration

**Impact:**
- Hitting luxury market hard
- Sellers now responsible
- Must factor into net proceeds

---

## Part 8: FSBO (For Sale By Owner) Strategy

### The Psychology

**Why FSBOs get LESS money:**

**Statistic:**
> For Sale By Owners get 16% less than homes sold through agents

**Why?**
1. **Limited reach** - Can't get on full MLS
2. **No negotiation skill** - Can't negotiate for themselves
3. **Wrong pricing** - Don't know market
4. **The hidden Commission cost**

### The Hidden Commission

**Scenario:**
- FSBO lists at $500K (price agent suggested)
- FSBO buyer sees "For Sale By Owner"
- Buyer thinks: "They're not paying 6% commission"
- Buyer offers $470K (6% less than asking)
- Seller thinks: "Well, I'm not paying commission anyway, so this is okay"

**Reality:**
- Seller just gave buyer the 6% commission
- Seller nets LESS than if they'd listed with agent
- Buyer AND seller both think they're saving money
- Only buyer actually saved

**Your listing presentation:**
> "You could try to do it yourself and net less, OR you could give me the listing and I'll:
> - Market to 3,000 agents
> - Create competition (multiple offers)
> - Get you HIGHER price
> - Handle all the work
> - Filter qualified buyers
> - Net you MORE money"

---

## Part 9: Non-Threatening Questions

### The Question-Based Selling Method

**Why questions work:**
- Keep conversation going
- Uncover needs
- Build trust
- Lead to logical thinking (not emotional)
- Non-threatening

**Dale Carnegie technique:**
> "Bring a person to proper thinking through a series of questions"

### Role Play: Buyer Call

**Setup:**
- Buyer calling about property
- Looking for 2 years
- Has 8-year-old son
- Budget $500,000
- Wants Morristown
- Schools most important

**Questions to ask:**
1. "Are you familiar with this area or new?"
2. "How long have you been looking?"
3. "In two years, was there a home you regret not buying?"
4. "If I found you a home in your preferred area, are you ready to make an offer now?"
5. "What's your budget?"
6. "How many bedrooms?"
7. **[When buyer mentions schools]** "How old are your children?" (ONLY after they bring it up - fair housing)
8. "What sports does your son like?"
9. "Do you have a home to sell first?"
10. "Why are you moving?"
11. "When are you free to see properties?"
12. "Will anyone else be coming with you?"
13. **[After they mention wife]** "Does she agree with you on the style of home?"
14. "Were there other homes you'd like to see besides this one?"

**What you're learning:**
- Family composition
- Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
- Timeline/urgency
- Motivation
- Decision-making process
- Pre-approval status

**Critical:**
> Don't put buyer's NAME in Showing Time unless you have 6-month buyer agreement. Use initials only (e.g., "JC from NYC").

---

### The "Regret Question"

**Most powerful question:**
> "Was there ever a home you saw that you regret you didn't buy?"

**Why it works:**
- Makes them relive the mistake
- You help them not repeat it
- They tell you exactly what they want
- Shows consequences of waiting

**Follow up:**
> "Why didn't you buy it?"
> "Do you think in retrospect you could have offered more?"

**Goal:**
- Help them act faster this time
- Understand their decision-making
- Position yourself as preventing regret

---

### Fair Housing & School Questions

**CANNOT ask:**
- "Do you have children?" (discriminatory)
- "What religion are you?" (discriminatory)
- "Where are you from?" (can imply discrimination)

**CAN ask (after THEY mention it):**
- "How old are your children?" (after they say "good schools")
- "What sports do they play?" (after they mention kids)

**School information:**
- CANNOT say: "Ridge School is better than Orchard School"
- CAN say: "Here's the state website with school ratings"
- CAN say: "I know a parent in that school district - would you like their contact info?"
- CAN provide: Test scores, demographics (publicly available data)

**Best practice:**
> "I recommend visiting the school yourself and speaking with the principal and teachers. Every family has different needs."

**Real discrimination story:**
> Agent's family looking at Randolph schools. Front desk lady: "You'll be better off in Roxbury, it's more diverse there."
>
> Went to middle school, same town: Lady looked them up and down, judging jewelry, wouldn't help.
>
> Went to New Milford: Principal came out, very warm and inviting.
>
> **Lesson:** Ignorance exists everywhere. Don't make assumptions. Provide information and let clients decide.

## Part 10: Role Playing Practice

### Objection Handling

**Use ChatGPT:**
> "I'm a brand new listing agent. Give me all the objections a seller could make and answers to those objections."

**Practice daily:**
- With fellow agents
- Record yourself
- Listen back
- Refine responses

### Asking for the Sale

**After showing property:**
> "So on a scale of 1-10, how do you feel about this house?"

**If they like it:**
> "Is this a home we should keep on our 'perhaps' list?"
> "Is this a home you'd consider making an offer on?"

**The power of silence:**
- Ask question
- Stop talking
- Wait for answer
- Don't fill silence

### The Showing Debrief

**Before entering house:**
> "How do you feel about the curb appeal?"

**Before leaving property:**
> "I have a favor to ask. When we exit, I want you to tell me everything you DISLIKED about this house. And also everything you liked."

**Why this works:**
- Gives them permission to be honest
- They won't feel rude criticizing
- You get real feedback
- Can address concerns or move on

## Key Quotes to Remember

**On confidentiality:**
> "Anything of substance must be disclosed. Anything that would cause buyer to pay more or seller to get less cannot be disclosed."

**On timeline management:**
> "Every date should be in your phone. Don't rely on attorney, listing agent, or anyone else. You are responsible."

**On seller's concessions:**
> "Money is fungible. You can move it around. The seller doesn't get more because they're crediting it back to the buyer."

**On FSBO:**
> "The FSBO buyer comes in, likes the house, thinks 'they're not paying 6%, so I'll offer 6% less.' Seller thinks 'I'm not paying commission anyway' and accepts. Seller just gave buyer the commission."

**On questions:**
> "Every statement you make in role play must be in the form of a question to keep the conversation going."

**On teaching method:**
> "You retain 5% from lecture, 75% from practice, 90% from teaching others. Fill out contracts repeatedly."

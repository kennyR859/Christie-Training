2% consideration for 2 million to 32.5 and then for anybody who home has a home 3 million to 3.5 it's 3% and 3.5 consideration for any home over 3.5 so they have included they are really hitting hitting the luxury market and making copies of this for you to continue next week No no no I need this I need There's just so much with the timing I don't know what to check when I need to research the first



----------------------------
You will need it and no problem So let's pass these out so I have transfer fees i'm going to keep one for myself in my book and then pass these around that's good for you to have You might even want to keep it take a photo shot up and keep it in your phone so you can refer to it because it is a question that people ask all the time And then this is just some of the services you might want to review pass it around do everything pass that around from our our our title company which for disclosure we have AA relationship of fiduciary relationship with but when they come they'll explain to you that there is a great benefit for US agents and for your your sellers and buyers so the good thing about this title company is for Christy's agents let's say you are working on a listing and for some reason you look up go to taxes and you see if there are any liens sometimes you can see it sometimes you can't or that the sale price is 600,000 but it looks like they have a $600,000 mortgage you know this is we the expression we use for that is the house is underwater means that there's not enough money to pay the lawyers the transfer taxes the exit taxes all of the taxes and you and the Realtors Why is that important because that's what you work for you know so that may be a case where you have to do called her bank and see if you can help the buyer the seller with a short sale Everybody know what a short sale is not me it's it is a way to forestall in some cases it may eventually go to foreclosure but for stole foreclosure banks are usually receptive to it so let's say they owe the bank $600,000 and sometimes that isn't really the principle that happens to be what they owe the bank plus all the penalties because they haven't paid the mortgage And the penalties are hefty hefty if you don't pay your mortgage on time so with penalties the banks turn into like mafia hard money places basically you know their their penalties are terrible so anyway so you call the bank and this foreign person lost their job their wife is sick you know blah blah blah all these terrible things happen to them and you ask the bank is there any way that we could reduce the penalties and reduce the mortgage saving you Mr Bank cost and frustration of running a foreclosure which is expensive for a bank to do and legally legally complex OK so sometimes they do that they say OK You know let's get the attorney so you buy your seller will probably have to hire an attorney involved and they come up with a number that will allow the home to be sold perhaps to allow the seller to have some capital and to pay the taxes the mortgages to pay the Realtors and the and the buyer's agent the listing agent and the buyer's agent so that works out pretty good sometimes that can be it takes 6 months to orchestrate pretty much Now they claim they've gotten better at it but nobody in the bank wants to sign off on it is what I think they're afraid to sign off on so you got to really work on it you know and and the lawyer basically does most of the work not you you know but now let's say you're in a situation and you don't know if that exists you know if that true is that going to be a problem what can you do the great thing is that this title company will run a quick title search Let us know if there's enough money to close and that's cool they do it for free they will also sometimes you have property and you look at the flood map in this nebulous you can't tell for sure could it be could it could be right on the border they'll look into that and make sure whether it's in the flood zone or not and what floats you know what flood zone is in so they're they're very very helpful and I think we're coming up with some kind of plan too if our our client uses them they'll offer to give you some mail out cards that they will mail for you like just sold cards or something like that you know so so II like them I met with them II certainly approve I think they're very professional and so the thing is that on here on your contract it will ask as to what title company they're using you can put Regency down there but it doesn't mean the attorney will use them sometimes attorneys have their own title companies sometimes they have a relationship with the title company so not necessarily are they going to be used the biggest benefit to your customer is that when we're trying to expedite a transaction and by that I mean cut the timing short so that the seller feels secure that this transaction isn't going to take a year and a day it's going to move on swiftly and expeditiously What they will do is here's how a transaction goes attorney review OK under contract OK Mortgage in OK that is when the attorney calls the title Company Then it can take more time With Regency if the attorney calls the title company right away they will do the title if the deal fails or dies during the home inspection or the mortgage application or anything like that they will not charge our buyers Pretty nice So we don't have to wait until the mortgage commitment is in in order to go forward with the closing and the title work right because title work sometimes can take a while right so I'm going to confirm all that again because that's what they presented but II would like to confirm it again and they will be here to explain that to you and then you can ask them all the questions you might want to ask about title and title insurance So what is title insurance it just insures and after you buy the property that nobody can come back and say hey a long time ago I owned a piece of this property right it is yours that that you're covered for that.

who hires who? who has control? buyer or attorney. make table format of morgage attorney aprasir inspection etc. and time frame of buying process. make a seperate doc to explain, use deep research. 


------------------------------------------------
False impersonation undisclosed errors or detempering legal defense if somebody challenges your ownership yes it's it's pretty cool I didn't the other title companies we've had or worked with in the past didn't have this you know so did I pass this around it did right so read it a little bit so when they come you know enough to ask questions which will be good OK so we're not going to do any more of this on Tuesday and but what we are going to do is open up our books I think I need this one and we'll have a little bit of fun So I use this this When Elia asked me to do this we didn't have a training program and he asked me to develop a training program for this agents in person training program my other card this is your book no I left my book in my another part of the building OK let me pull out the pages that you will need So anyway so I use this is called the ropes teaching method and I stole it from my sister who is a teacher and award winning teacher and this is one of the things that they discovered so if you see this triangle lecture this is all you're going to even if you're the most brilliant person in the world 5% that's what you that's what you absorb after a day or two that's what stays with you reading 10% audio visual 20% demonstration 30% group discussion 50% that's why I like more discussion going on here you know you ask questions talk about it practice by doing you'll retain 75% and teaching others 90% so when I see you know you working together with each other which will happen when Wendy comes in she's teaching others Slavis teaching others Sammy's teaching others you'll retain more you know but the important thing is that in order for you to absorb all of this you know you need to practice so fill out that contract fill it out as many times as you can you know and there will always be copies of it around or you can go into your zip forms Problem with zip forms make sure you don't send any out but problem with zip forms is you can't get rid of it once it's on there it but you can archive it it'll always be there but practice it all you want and archive them you know let me see what I can do I may have other pages here we just use like any house on the Pakistan country yeah yeah yeah but just be careful that you know going forward and send it that would be crazy right but it could happen and that that's the only problem with it let's see do I have anything in here that would help me with you OK this is my extra form so I see



--------------------------------


Then what for Sale by owner gets and let's analyze that the workings of that why do you think that would happen So for Sale by our home home owners trying to sell their home on their own they put an ad in the newspaper maybe they put a sign outside for Sale by owner why would they get less because the range is physically I mean possible to compete with it Yeah reaches it strong what else they can't negotiate for themselves MLS They cannot put on MLS but actually they can't there there there are some MLS's that will allow a homeowner just to put it on but they can also put it on Zillow right what what else would have got under fries for example they're asking for 100,000 and they think that they can only get that amount like if you go with a listing agent with a agent then maybe they can get more money pricing making sure that they're priced properly What else The real underlying fact of the real underlying psychology of a for Sale by owner seller and a for Sale by owner of fire what does that mean Can you rephrase one more time can you rephrase one more time the question so there's how would I rephrase that so you have a seller that is trying to sell on his own pretty much so that he can save paying the Commission correct Right you have a buyer who's trying to buy a home directly from the seller thinking maybe he can save the Commission The world thinks we're at 6% Most people feel we're at 6% still from an old time they they really don't know but they think 6% is the number So the for Sale by owner buyer comes in likes the house decides to make an offer And you're right you know might not they might have gotten better if they had it on with multiple offers right but he says to himself or she says to herself wait a minute they're not paying a Commission so I'm going to make an offer 6% less right now the seller's so happy to have an offer They rationalize they quantify well wait a minute you know what maybe this isn't so bad because if I list it with a realtor I'd be paying them 6% And sometimes they might negotiate it a little bit but that's exactly what happens And and for sale my owners don't realize it because there's one Commission now can they split it maybe but they both can't get it right they both can't get the whole Commission right you understand I don't know do you really understand me note talking about like dual agency like they both can't get the Commission yeah I'm not talking about dual agency was was there any agent in the no no so who gets the Commission or whatever which commissioner nobody so that so when is an agent a buyer's union a seller's agent there's one Commission and they split it it's not that 3% for this one and 3% for the other yeah but I'm not talking i'm talking about it for Sale by owner yeah right where where there is no realtor there's just a seller and a buyer right and and there is no fiduciary relationship to anybody other than the seller and the buyer and this is how a seller for Sale by owner works unless you come in and list it right so the owner is saying this is the price he may have called Realtors in to give him a price by the way you might have been in that situation where you gave him a price he puts it on at that price right The buyer drives by seats for Sale by owner thinks Oh my goodness I'm going to take a look at this house I like the outside goes in decides he's going to make an offer but he's thinking about his offer he has nobody to advise him he's just thinking about the offer and he sees you know what they're not paying a Commission to a broker so I'm going to make my offer 6% less And that's exactly what happens OK and I can tell you in practice I've seen it happen I had a client called me and it was right around the second of July and they I gave them a price they wanted to list it with me but they were honest enough to tell me that they were gonna wait till after the 4th of July parade and then we're gonna put a sign out because the 4th of July parade in Ridgewood goes right by their house And so I tried to explain to them that you probably will get less or you know people they didn't want it they wanted to try to do it themselves So what could I do of course they did and nothing I said would have changed their mind So what did they do they put it on at the price I told them and what did they get 6% less I said but you know you just got 6% less you just paid the Commission whether you wanted to or not you don't realize you paid it to this buyer and they they were like baffled they just couldn't grasp the idea right and that's exactly what happens so when you can easily explain that I don't know if I've helped you explaining it but when you can easily explain that to a seller who's a for Sale by owner you may be able to list their property right so the question is do you give me the compensation because I am going to bring you higher prices i'm going to take care of all of your work i'm going to take care of all of your marketing you have no expenses in the newspaper i'm going to filter through the buyers i'm going to make sure they're qualified i'm going to do a list you have that list with a little red outline of all the things I'm going to do for you you know and you will net more or you could try to do it by yourself and net less I said I'm sorry They they are dealing in that case with all this paper job like by law yeah contract and do everything yeah well they can hire an attorney to do it but they still have to abide by all the rules and regulations yeah yeah and they are responsible so they paint they have to do the lead paint they have to do the seller's disclosure the homeowners property information they have to do everything I think it's stupid to say 3% thinking to say percent and be responsible or or all this paperwork yeah and and by the way in that case probably because the lawyer is going to have to handle all of that he's probably going to charge you more so but that's what that's what goes on looks for sale items so anyway OK so here's here is this page 6 read it understand it you know there there's some things in here I don't I have to read them again because I haven't seen them this was updated again too but make sure you don't do any of the scare tactics that a lot of Realtors do a lot of actors a lot of Realtors will say hey you know you don't know who's coming into your house You know me I will be able to filter it but be careful you don't scare them you can say look I'll filter everybody that comes into your home they'll be guided by a realtor or myself but don't you know in this day and age I think there's less for Sale by owner activities because they are afraid of who's coming into their house OK now where I want to go to have fun today is page 10 And since I think that most of you are so qualified to be on Off City should you decide I need you to know this I need you to know and role play this page how we doing OK don't even have enough time to fully do this these are the non threatening questions

page 10 Questions to Ask. 

I'm a seller you're buyer I buy it yeah it could be either but I'm searching for the house I want for my family I need at least two bedroom okay and a very good location to have very nice school in the area I'm so glad you called us by the way are you familiar with this area or are you new to this area i'm new for Emily Saturday do you know anybody who's ever that lives here at all No I don't have OK so I'd like to ask you a few questions before we meet You know aside from the very basic questions would be what price sharing range you're in but like let's talk about how long you've been looking have you been looking for an extended period of time you just started OK Let's change that a bit say you've been looking for two years I'm I'm searching for two years OK let me ask you a question you you should be really knowledgeable about the the area now to some degree after two years and that's great I love I love a knowledgeable buyer so during that 2 year. Was there a home that perhaps you are sorry you didn't make an offer on or you didn't buy yes I have seen a lot but I did not like the area for my family that I didn't like the school Yeah so may I ask you this question If I were to find you a home in the area that you like which will kind of discuss a little bit further which areas you choose and the schools that you prefer are you perhaps ready to make an offer now Yes it depends on the budget my budget is 500,000 OK 500,000 and you want how many bedrooms was that again two two bedroom two bedrooms and what areas do you think you would like to look in now I need to say some cities or some areas like towns maybe Maurice town in Morristown OK so now I as a realtor and he's calling a realtor in Ridgewood I don't know Morristown right but I can know it quick I can do a quick study right so I said was there a particular street or neighborhood that you saw that you liked in Morristown As I told you for me the most important is the school school OK what kind of school will be and what time People toby Elite david how old are your children eight years old OK both twins 0 just one child and it's a boy or girl boy now I can't ask him that in the beginning I can't ask him if he has any children in the beginning did you notice that I stir until he brought up that at schools and then I can go into it because it's prejudicial it could be against fair housing if I say to you do you have any children Because you might I might hurt your feelings you know and so but I can do that once he brings up different things about schools and then I ask how old the children are and then I can go into it you know what about sports Sports yes it's also a very important but if the school is good there will be also there but what what sport does your son like boxing boxing wow OK so these are now I'm i'm really finding out a lot about this man it's not like you know I can look up two bedroom homes all over the place but I'll never until I get to know what this man and his family are like i'm going to sell them a house too many times we I ask agents what is what does your client do for a living they don't know you know what what kind of family they don't know they don't know anything just nobody wants a two bedroom 1 1/2 bath family room and a kitchen and a basement that's finished or whatever you got to know the answers because now he's investing in me information i'm getting information from him he actually called to get information from me Right but the tables have turned i'm getting information from him so let me ask you a question David do you have a home that's on the market right now do you have a home right now no I don't have so you've been renting yeah oh that's great so anything you buy it won't be contingent upon the sale of your home right that puts you in a very positive light you realize that yeah OK so And if I if you don't mind why are you moving Because I don't want to pay the rent anymore got you I understand that my rents have gone up so high right yeah it's very high and also I'm thinking that when you pay the rent you throwing money away it's much better to buy my own place instead of paying the rent to pay the mortgage little bit more but this money will be mine in the future and the property will be mine I absolutely agree with you I absolutely agree with you now I have 10 questions here II should probably stop now because I don't want it to be an interrogatory but it doesn't mean that I might not ask him one more question OK so he calls me and usually people call on the specific house by the way not just out of the blue but but OK so now I'm going to ask him one more question so actually too David when would you be free to come out and look at some homes when can we meet next weekend time OK so let's firm that up is next Thursday good for you OK great what time is good for you After 4:00 PM OK will anybody else be coming with you david yes for my most probably my wife would OK I can't ask him if he has a wife right but now I know he has a wife right by the way just out of curiosity does she agree with you on the style of home I have no idea because we never went out we have never chatted together OK OK OK So one of the I have one more question for you and then I'm gonna let you go Was there any other home besides this one that you would like that you looked at that you might like to see Yes most probably because well she's surfing houses on the Zillow and if you will have the chance to show us OK why why don't you send me those particular homes that will help me get an idea of what you like and then perhaps I can add some other homes and we can see which ones we want to see by next Thursday all right does that work for you don't you need.




Right but when you see them in person you do but I haven't met him in person yet OK so now I talk to him through the week he's going to show me some homes right i'm going to call him back and when I say thanks I get that's great sent for thanking me you know sending me these homes I will try to make appointments with them My suggestion is you sent me four homes and we'll try to see if we can see all 4 if I can make the appointments by the way David I'm not sure you're aware of it but I'm going to send you a buyers agreement By now the new law has changed and before I can show you these homes I will need you to sign a Buyer's agreement and you can either look at it I'll send it to you and then when you arrive at my office we can review them and I can explain it to you or I can explain it to you over the phone after you've read it the agreement can be for just those 4 homes If we decide to work together longer perhaps you will sign it for a longer period of time I will probably most likely only show you homes where the seller is paying the compensation that's great please send me on my email and I will email it too so you're allowed to talk about the well you recommend talking about the buyers.



Yeah there's no we don't have any secrets that we can't talk about to anything the only secrets we keep is secrets that are confidential on the part of the buyer and secrets that are confidential on part of the seller other than that yeah Full disclosure right what if David says to me let's handle this another way let's say David said you know I did see a house that I liked way back when let's do that david by the way did have you ever during your looking for the past couple years it was ever a home that you kind of resent that you didn't make an offer that you didn't buy no I didn't like any of those OK but you did pretend you did this this happens all the time People do see a home that they didn't move on and they're sorry I saw a home that I I'm sorry I didn't buy you know go ahead I think that's so the house sorry II need to say that I have seen that there was one house that you looked at that you didn't buy and you're sorry you didn't buy it Oh yeah II found the very perfect place for us but the offer I have sent wasn't enough and they it was sold to somebody else so just that it you know would help me to you know since you really like that home enough to make an offer on it could you describe the house to me It was with a pool with 22 car garage It was uh in the very very colorful man and very green neighborhood close to the city center and nearby was very nice school nice school OK and so are all of those features very still very important to you like is the pool still very important to you Most important is school most important would be the school you do with that what about the interior of the house was it very updated was it modern or was it was well furnished the kitchen and we did not need to do any any maintenance OK if we find something similar but you might need to do a little bit of upgrading is that possible yeah sure OK OK so I could keep going and going on this conversation for a very long time I could ask him what color the kitchen was you know how how large the lot was I want him to relive that house not that I'm going to be able to duplicate it because I don't really care i'm going to find him a home but it helps me find something he likes but I want him to relive the mistake he made because he still remembers it so David II have a question So what why why didn't you buy it you know were you not able to come up to the price or yes the offer was too too low too low yeah in retrospect do you think Helping me did not advise me to offer more I see I see but in retrospect you you think you could have offered more yeah sure OK OK well unfortunately you lost that house but we'll try to do our best to find something similar and you don't have to worry about me I'll tell you when you need to make a better offer but anyway so all of these things are helping me find out something about him and usually there's more that comes out much much more you know my wife loves the There was an extra room you know there was this she loved the size of the bedrooms you know all of this stuff comes out and then you are really getting into learning how to see the new properties that you're going to be looking at through their eyes so I've had a couple that said to me I don't want a BI level They had no idea what a buy level was I showed them a buy level and they bought it Yeah and and I had a couple that said to me I don't want to live and somebody told me not to live in this particular town and we're driving through the town and I said II know I understand why somebody would tell you it's just a lovely town and then they realized it was they had the wrong name you know it was the wrong name you know they said not to buy a Wyckoff how could you not want to buy in Wyckoff you know and so when things don't make sense to you question them question them question them question them and it was they they they got the town name totally mixed up they were $3 million buyer and the person had said Waldwick which is a lovely town although it's a first home buyers town you know with a blue school blue ribbon school there's nothing wrong with the town but it certainly doesn't have any $3 million homes Yeah so anyway that's the fun thing so there are some other questions here I want to go through question we're not allowed to discuss discuss schools right why not what do you mean by discuss them like share ratings and well when I was looking for homes first thing that I was looking I would go into the town and going if I pick it do every every time before we went out to sea Homes we would go to the town and walk into the school and ask questions to right and that was brilliant of you that's what we did and we went in for example we went into Randolph and we was we were two days there as we was going to see a home but we went in to round up to to interview the principal we tried at least to interview somebody and beautiful school it's a blue ribbon outside say this say that but as soon as I walked in the lady was tearing me out of the town She like you'll be better off and Roxbury it's more diverse there really yeah holy cow yeah holy cow who said that the second the lady at the front desk in the school randolph and I was and I was just laughing I just thought I cracked up and walked out and let you see this is why I don't like this time I walked out and left my wife there and then we went to another school the middle school in is this recently this was I left the review This was like maybe two years ago my God should I yeah yeah you better off in Roxby why is that so she's like oh it's more diverse there You started laughing and then I went to the middle school look at you know we're gonna find ignorant people everywhere you know and unfortunately but that that woman should be fired I went to the gym school and the lady she just like kept like she was very fancy and what not in the same town and the lady just came up to us and she's just looking at us up and down looking at us up and down she's looking at my wife's jewelry and I'm like hello hi where you know can we speak to a special you know a special needs 'cause my kids have social needs so they require different curriculum So can we speak to somebody that handles this or you know I want to see what curriculum do they offer the kids before I move here you got to email This person goodbye And she was just like looking at us i'm like but then I went to New Milford even though I wouldn't want to move to New Milford not so much 'cause not like you said I don't have the 1,000,000 dollar homes So but I went into the school and the principal was the principal came out he was so inviting very warm it was great but there wasn't there they didn't have any homes I wanted I'm so sorry you had to go through that II just think that that is you know you just ran into it the principal might have been great in that first goal they he just had an ignorant person working for crazy but the every agent that I worked with they said we can advise on the schools Can we give information on schools yes there's all kinds of documentation and different sources to go to look at schools I can't say that the Ridge school is better than the Orchard school I can't do that 'cause I don't know I don't want to know And and most of the time that's only public opinion it's not accurate you if you were in Ridgewood right now that the Ridge School is considered better than Orchard they have the same They have the same you know directors of what do they call in above the chiefs of principal 0 my God Superintendent same Superintendent same curriculum but people just say that you know they just say that so II don't know if we should do that because at one point the Country Club section of Ridgewood was the in place Then it became the height section and it moves back a little bit it could become misleading because this year would be great the schools like right now in Cresco the schools when I moved in there were great but they're little they're falling a little they change all the time so they change they change every year they change the Superintendent they could change the principal next semester and it's so it's it's not something you can do what I have done in the past is I have because I've been working here so long I have referred them to people in that school system to talk to that's awesome yeah that's good 'cause I wish You're focused on a town you should know who to call in each town like somebody that you can speak to the Superintendent or or even on a more personal level I did it you know this this group of mine has lived here for 5 years she has her kids in school would you like to have a conversation and and then you know when it's a special needs situation is really very very very important You know I had a son I have a son who has severe dyslexia and so I needed to to find the right school and sometimes it wound up to be a private school and by the way how old is your son 9 my my my daughters are they they have semi semi severe dyslexia and they're 11 and 14 OK so so you might find that what I finally did with my son because it was very severe is I happen to be at a dinner and you all probably won't know this name but Charles Kuralt used to do 60 minutes on Sunday you know he was a newscaster very brilliant man and I happened to sit next to him and he had done a piece on a school up in South Wales New York and it was a school for at that time only boys with dyslexia it's very rare that girls have it now it's something new IT was mostly a male dominated you know dysfunction basically of the ability to read but can also be auditory and so so Matthew unfortunately has both auditory spatial and and visual so we tried different schools and there was not much success and then when Charles told me about that we drove up to South Wales matthew loved the school it was but now they take girls and it's a fabulous fabulous school it is it's run differently it's like you know when kids get a test it's like they fail or they pass it's you know not there it's OK now I know what you need to learn you know II see the gaps I need where you know so the test isn't to make them a failure or a success so to speak just to find out what they need you know and II love love love that school it's a high school in Cresco we have they they offer they have a good program they've done very good Well this was for high school anyway you know it wasn't for grammar school but pretty nice everybody you know like II felt like my kids had their own personal teacher 0 good OK OK and that's the thing like why I didn't why I was very well my wife she's a professor why we was very picky on what town we don't want our kids to feel special needs No I know it's horrible to you know because I went into Bergenfield like let me see when I was I wanted to see let's let's go see what Bergenfield offers for the kids and and and like as soon as they came out and like oh they're in their special education and they're kept on this floor I like let's walk let's walk the hell out of here because we don't special education you know like I remember when I was in high school and Manhattan in Washington nights if you were in if you were considering special education you you made fun of yeah right yeah it was very hard so as soon as they say oh especially the patient like let's get out here you know you know they it's not the new word yeah no II went to Mother Cabrini High School oh II grew up in that area yeah I know 5 sometimes yeah so the the the thing about the GAO school is though it's not like a separation because all the kids have similar problems but they teach them to overcome it as best they can and they have horseback riding and they have this and they have that and it's expensive but I have to tell you it's the best money ever spent because he left there with confidence to go on to college which sometimes they don't you know these kids don't anyway OK so I have saved you from another couple hours of this contract I do want you to read over those questions I want you to play with them I want you to turn on your recorder on your phone and ask them I want you to play with chat GBT and and have objections and we'll have fun with that on Tuesday too because the rest of it won't take the whole course OK but and then we're gonna role play Role playing is the best part of learning you know learning how to role play and then what other things that we'll do aside from what Sammy and everybody else is doing is we will learn how to ask for the sale and we will learn how to ask for objections we want objections most Realtors shy away from objections we want them bring them on right because an objection means that there is something other than that one little thing or maybe major thing about this house that they like you know and so the question you ask is you know what is it about you like this house and what is it that you don't like well I don't like the size of the 3rd bedroom well let me ask you one more question if it weren't for the size of that 3rd bedroom how is everything else in this house everything else suits your needs yeah perfectly So would you consider you know there's no perfect house would you consider perhaps you know accepting the smaller bedroom and making it an office Would you consider this house you know if it weren't for that 3rd bedroom so maybe we should see all the pros about this house and go through it but I'll go through it more softly but it is you want that objection otherwise you have nothing to work with Bad is that they stay shut and keep it to themselves and that's perfect they do do it because I gotta tell you the majority of people are nice so you're taking him through the house they don't want to say anything negative'cause they don't want to hurt your feelings they don't want to hurt the homeowners feelings and by the way most most homes have listening devices be careful careful what you say And also what I tell everybody to do and this is what you're going to practice over this weekend is saying to them look when you meet them in front of the house so you start asking questions before we go into the house they just want to ask you you know how do you feel about the curb appeal simple easy question not threatening I like it you know it's too woodsy it's not you know whatever it is and say like I have a favor to ask you before we go in the house when we come out when we exit the house I want you to tell me everything you disliked about this home I even use the word hate some people are uncomfortable I say I want you to tell me everything you hate about this house and I always say that first and then say and also everything you like about the house that gives them permission to tell me that gives information to say firm flight and God's name would you ever show me this house it's horrible and and that is what you want them to do and so make sure you practice that and then when they get out that's when you can say OK lay it on me you know what did you talk about this Yep Yep and then of course when they come out they can tell you what they like about the house and that's when you can perhaps say you know one of two things one is this a home that we should keep on our perhaps list is this a home that we might think that we might make an offer on If not let me know and then you go to the next house and you do the same thing on every at every house right



-------------- Rents have gone up if it's a house if it's a house where they have all leases you know make sure you look at what the real lease could be so that you make it so that you can educate your buyer because rents have gone crazy I was getting 2200 on one apt right and the person left and then I started looking at what the real rent should be for the new tenant and I figure oh maybe 29 and II had five people you know I already signed one for 29 for a young couple and I couldn't stop I mean I didn't sign it but I gave them my word and I already had three other people saying we'll go up to 33 so from 22 to 33 a $1000 increase it was crazy it's crazy the rents so don't trust the old leases OK you know and and as I said before if you really want to buy a two family You can't look at profit right now unless it's all cash you know you have to look that it maintains itself and it'll it it eventually will catch up you know yeah and you when you can you have to consider the write offs and the depreciation and all that against your taxes So it really it really does help thank you Sir oh you're welcome have a good weekend have a good weekend

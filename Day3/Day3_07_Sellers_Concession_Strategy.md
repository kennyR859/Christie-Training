# Day 3 - Topic 07: Seller's Concession Strategy

## Overview
Seller's concessions are a powerful tool for helping buyers qualify for better financing and stronger loan terms. Understanding the math and strategy behind concessions can make the difference between a deal happening or failing, especially for FHA and VA buyers.

## What is a Seller's Concession?

### Definition

**Seller's concession:**
> Money the seller credits to the buyer at closing to help cover closing costs

**How it works:**
1. Seller agrees to provide credit (e.g., $10,000)
2. Credit appears on closing statement
3. Buyer uses credit toward closing costs
4. Buyer's out-of-pocket expense reduced by credit amount

**Key distinction:**
- **Seller pays:** Money comes from seller's proceeds
- **Buyer receives:** Reduces buyer's cash needed at closing
- **Net effect:** Helps buyer afford the transaction

## What Banks WILL and WON'T Allow

### What Banks WILL Allow

**Seller credit for closing costs:**
- ✅ Lender fees (origination, processing, underwriting)
- ✅ Title insurance
- ✅ Appraisal fee
- ✅ Credit report fee
- ✅ Recording fees
- ✅ Attorney fees
- ✅ Prepaid property taxes
- ✅ Prepaid homeowner insurance
- ✅ HOA transfer fees

**Why banks allow:**
- Standard transaction costs
- Not changing property condition
- Documented expenses
- Part of normal closing process

### What Banks WILL NOT Allow

**Seller credit for repairs or inspection items:**
- ❌ Repair roof
- ❌ Fix HVAC system
- ❌ Replace hot water heater
- ❌ Repair foundation
- ❌ Fix plumbing issues
- ❌ Address inspection findings

**Why banks don't allow:**
- Affects property value
- Property must be in acceptable condition for loan
- Can't hide defects with credits
- Repairs must be completed before closing OR
- Price must be reduced to reflect needed repairs

**Exception:**
- 203K loan specifically for purchase + repairs
- Different process entirely

## The Critical Strategy for FHA/VA Buyers

### The Problem

**Scenario:**
- Buyer needs FHA loan (3.5% down)
- Purchase price: $300,000
- Down payment required: $10,500 (3.5%)
- Closing costs: ~$9,000
- **Total cash needed: $19,500**

**Buyer has:**
- Exactly $19,500 saved
- Nothing more
- Can't do conventional (requires 10% = $30,000 down)

**Issue:**
- FHA loan = higher monthly payment (FHA mortgage insurance)
- Buyer would benefit from conventional loan
- But doesn't have enough for 10% down payment
- Stuck with FHA

---

### The Solution: Raise Price, Give Credit

**The strategy:**
1. **Raise purchase price** by amount of closing costs ($9,000)
2. **Seller credits back** closing costs ($9,000)
3. **Buyer converts** closing cost money to down payment instead
4. **Result:** Buyer now has enough for conventional loan (10% down)

**The math:**

**Original FHA deal:**
- Purchase price: $300,000
- Down payment (3.5%): $10,500
- Closing costs: $9,000
- Buyer's total cash: $19,500
- Loan type: FHA

**New conventional deal:**
- Purchase price: **$309,000** (raised by $9,000)
- Down payment (10%): **$30,900**
- Closing costs: $9,000 **(seller credit)**
- Buyer's total cash: $30,900
- Buyer uses their $19,500 + $9,000 (that would've gone to closing costs)
- Loan type: **Conventional**

**Seller's net:**
- Original: $300,000 - closing costs seller pays
- New: $309,000 - $9,000 credit - closing costs seller pays
- **Same net proceeds to seller**

---

### Why This Works

**Buyer benefits:**
- Better loan product (conventional vs FHA)
- No FHA mortgage insurance premium
- Lower monthly payment
- Better interest rate
- Easier to qualify
- More attractive to seller (conventional loan is stronger)

**Seller benefits:**
- Same net proceeds
- Conventional loan more likely to close (FHA is stricter on property condition)
- Buyer's lower monthly payment = more stable buyer
- Deal more likely to appraise (conventional more flexible)

**Example monthly payment difference:**

**FHA Loan ($289,500 @ 6.5% + FHA MI):**
- Monthly payment: ~$2,100

**Conventional Loan ($278,100 @ 6.25%):**
- Monthly payment: ~$1,710

**Savings: $390/month** for exact same house, same cash out of pocket

## Will It Appraise?

### The Appraisal Question

**Concern:**
> "When appraiser sees seller giving back closing costs, question is: What are they really selling it for?"

**Appraiser's perspective:**
- Purchase price: $309,000
- Seller credit: $9,000
- Net to seller: $300,000
- **Is property really worth $309,000 or $300,000?**

### Why It Usually Works

**In hot market with homes going over asking:**
- Properties routinely sell above asking
- Multiple offers driving prices up
- Appraisers see this pattern
- $309,000 vs $300,000 is 3% difference
- Within normal market fluctuation
- Usually not a problem

**Supporting the appraisal:**
- Provide strong comps at or above $309K
- Explain competitive market
- Show multiple offer situation
- Demonstrate value justification

**Instructor's note:**
> "In hot market with homes going over asking, usually not a problem."

## Requires Cooperation and Education

### Not All Agents Understand This

**The challenge:**
> "Many listing agents don't even think of this. They're not trained. You have to almost educate your listing agent."

**Why listing agents resist:**
- Don't understand the math
- Think seller is "giving money away"
- Fear appraisal won't support higher price
- Never used strategy before
- Skeptical of anything unusual

### Your Job: Educate Everyone

**Explaining to listing agent:**
> "My buyer wants to make a strong offer with conventional financing instead of FHA. To help them qualify for conventional, we'd like to offer $309,000 with a $9,000 seller credit for closing costs. Your seller nets the exact same $300,000, but my buyer gets a much better loan product, lower monthly payment, and we're more likely to close because conventional loans are easier on property condition. This is a win-win."

**Show the math:**
- Write it out
- Compare side-by-side
- Demonstrate seller's net is identical
- Emphasize buyer's stronger financing

**Explaining to seller:**
> "You're not giving money away. You're receiving the same net proceeds. The higher price helps the buyer qualify for a better loan, which makes them a stronger buyer and more likely to close. Conventional loans are preferable to FHA because they're less strict on property condition."

**Explaining to buyer:**
> "By structuring the offer this way, you can use conventional financing instead of FHA. Your monthly payment will be about $390 lower, you'll avoid FHA mortgage insurance, and you'll be a more attractive buyer to the seller. It costs you the same cash out of pocket, but gives you a much better loan."

## When to Use This Strategy

### Ideal Situations

**1. FHA or VA buyer wants to convert to conventional**
- Buyer has exactly enough for FHA/VA + closing costs
- Can't afford conventional down payment
- Would benefit from conventional loan terms

**2. Buyer needs help with closing costs**
- Buyer maxed out on cash for down payment
- Has exactly enough but no cushion
- Seller willing to help

**3. Competitive market supports higher price**
- Properties selling over asking
- Appraisal likely to support raised price
- Market conditions justify pricing

### When NOT to Use

**1. Buyer's market with falling prices**
- Appraisal unlikely to support raised price
- Seller resistant to higher price (even with credit)
- Better to just negotiate lower price

**2. Price already at top of market**
- Property already at maximum value
- Raising price won't appraise
- Better to structure differently

**3. Cash buyer**
- No financing to improve
- No closing cost financing restrictions
- Just negotiate price directly

## Alternative Structures

### Option 1: Seller Pays Closing Costs Directly

**Instead of credit:**
- Seller agrees to pay specific closing costs
- Written into contract
- Seller pays title company, attorney, etc.
- Same economic effect

**Pros:**
- More traditional
- Some sellers understand better
- Same result

**Cons:**
- Less flexible
- Costs must be estimated accurately
- If costs higher than estimated, buyer pays difference

### Option 2: Price Reduction + Buyer Covers Closing

**Traditional approach:**
- Lower purchase price
- Buyer pays all closing costs
- Simple structure

**When this works better:**
- Buyer has plenty of cash
- Doesn't need financing help
- Lower price helps with appraisal
- Simpler for all parties

### Option 3: Seller Credit for Specific Items

**Limited credit:**
- Seller credits $3,000 toward buyer's closing costs
- Not full amount
- Helps buyer but less dramatic

**When to use:**
- Buyer just needs small help
- Seller resistant to large credit
- Middle ground in negotiation

---

## Common Objections and Responses

### Seller: "I don't want to give the buyer my money"

**Response:**
> "You're not giving them your money. Look at the math: You net the same amount either way. The higher price simply helps the buyer qualify for better financing, which makes them a stronger buyer more likely to close. You receive the exact same check at closing."

### Listing Agent: "That won't appraise"

**Response:**
> "In this market, homes are regularly selling above asking. I have comps showing properties at this price point. The $9,000 difference is only 3%, well within normal market variation. I'll provide strong comps to the appraiser to support the value."

### Lender: "This looks like circumventing down payment requirements"

**Response:**
> "This is a legitimate seller concession for closing costs, which is allowed by all loan programs. The buyer is still providing the required down payment percentage from their own funds. The seller credit is being used for eligible closing costs, not down payment."

### Appraiser: "Purchase price seems inflated"

**Response:**
> "The purchase price reflects competitive market conditions. Here are comparable sales supporting this value. The seller concession is a standard negotiated term and doesn't change the property's market value."

---

## Documentation and Disclosure

### In the Contract

**Line 721 (Additional Contractual Provisions):**
> "Seller agrees to provide $9,000 credit to buyer at closing to be applied toward buyer's closing costs."

**Or:**
> "Purchase price includes seller concession of $9,000 toward buyer's closing costs."

**Be specific:**
- State exact amount
- Specify use (closing costs, not repairs)
- Include in written contract
- Attorney drafts properly

### Disclosure to Lender

**Lender must know:**
- Provide copy of contract showing concession
- Lender reviews and approves
- Included in loan calculations
- Reflected on Closing Disclosure

**Transparency required:**
- Never hide concessions from lender
- Fully disclosed in contract
- Lender factors into approval
- Standard practice, not deceptive

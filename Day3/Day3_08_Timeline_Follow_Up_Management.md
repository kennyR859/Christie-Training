# Day 3 - Topic 08: Timeline & Follow-Up Management

## Overview
Managing timelines and following up on every deadline is one of your most critical responsibilities. Missing a deadline can kill a deal, damage your reputation, and expose you to liability. This guide provides a comprehensive system for tracking and managing every aspect of the transaction timeline.

## Why Timeline Management is YOUR Job

### The Critical Principle

**Instructor's mandate:**
> "Every date should be in your phone. Don't rely on attorney, listing agent, or anyone else. You are responsible."

**Why you can't delegate this:**
- Attorney manages legal documents (not timelines)
- Listing agent manages seller (not your buyer's deadlines)
- Mortgage broker manages loan (not overall transaction)
- Title company manages closing (not contingency deadlines)
- **YOU are the quarterback** - only person tracking everything

**Your liability:**
- If mortgage commitment missed: Seller can walk, buyer loses deposit
- If deposit not delivered: Deal fails, you look unprofessional
- If inspection deadline missed: Buyer loses contingency protection
- If closing delayed: Both parties may have damages

---

## Critical Dates in Every Transaction

### Master Timeline Checklist

**1. Contract Fully Executed Date**
- Date both parties signed
- Day 0 of timeline
- All other dates calculated from this

**2. Attorney Review Period**
- 3 business days from fully executed contract
- Attorneys can cancel or modify contract
- Deal not binding until this period ends

**3. Additional Deposit Due**
- Usually 10 days after fully executed (but should be 1 day after attorney review)
- Usually 10% of purchase price
- Goes to seller's attorney escrow account

**4. Mortgage Application Deadline**
- Usually within 10 days of attorney review
- Should be immediate
- Buyer must submit complete application

**5. Home Inspection Deadline**
- Usually 10-14 days from attorney review
- Buyer's opportunity to inspect property
- Must be completed before deadline or buyer loses contingency

**6. Inspection Objection Deadline**
- Usually 3-5 days after inspection
- Buyer must notify seller of issues
- Request repairs or credits
- Or accept property as-is

**7. Mortgage Commitment Date**
- Usually 30-45 days from attorney review
- HARD deadline
- Deal can die if missed

**8. Final Walk-Through**
- Usually 1-3 days before closing
- Verify property condition
- Check agreed repairs completed
- Ensure property empty (if applicable)

**9. Closing Date**
- Ownership transfers
- Buyer gets keys
- Seller gets proceeds

## Calendar System Setup

### Put Every Date in Your Phone

**Day contract is signed:**
- [ ] Open phone calendar
- [ ] Create event for EVERY deadline
- [ ] Set multiple reminders for each

**For each deadline, set reminders:**
- 7 days before
- 3 days before
- 1 day before
- Day of deadline
- (For critical deadlines like mortgage commitment: also 14 days before)

**Example: Mortgage Commitment on March 30**

Calendar entries:
- March 16 (14 days before): "MORTGAGE COMMITMENT in 2 weeks - call broker for status"
- March 23 (7 days before): "MORTGAGE COMMITMENT in 1 week - verify on track"
- March 27 (3 days before): "MORTGAGE COMMITMENT in 3 days - get commitment letter OR request extension"
- March 29 (1 day before): "MORTGAGE COMMITMENT TOMORROW - confirm letter received"
- March 30 (day of): "MORTGAGE COMMITMENT DUE TODAY"

---

## The Two-to-Three Checkpoint Rule

### Never Assume Completion

**Instructor's rule:**
> "Two to three checkpoints for every deadline: (1) Remind client, (2) Confirm client did it, (3) Confirm receiving party got it."

**Why three checkpoints:**
- Clients forget
- Clients procrastinate
- Clients think they did it but didn't
- Receiving party may not have received it
- Email could be lost
- Check could be lost in mail
- Wire transfer could fail

### Real Story: The Missing Deposit

**What happened:**
> "New agent reminded buyer to deliver 10%. Wife said husband would do it tomorrow. Agent never checked again. At closing, 10% was never delivered. Had to run out and get it. Very embarrassing."

**What went wrong:**
- Checkpoint #1: ✓ Reminded buyer
- Checkpoint #2: ✗ Never confirmed buyer sent it
- Checkpoint #3: ✗ Never confirmed attorney received it

**Result:**
- Last-minute scramble
- Delayed closing
- Unprofessional appearance
- Stressful for everyone
- Could have killed deal

**How to prevent:**
1. **Day 1 (Remind):** "Your 10% deposit is due on Friday. Please wire or deliver certified check to seller's attorney by Friday at 5pm."
2. **Day 2 (Confirm sent):** "Hi, did you send the deposit yesterday? Can you forward me the wire confirmation or tracking number?"
3. **Day 3 (Confirm received):** Call seller's attorney: "Can you confirm you received the 10% deposit from my buyer?"

## Communication Templates

### Weekly Update Email

**Send to buyer every Friday:**

> Subject: Weekly Update - [Property Address]
>
> Hi [Buyer],
>
> Quick update on your purchase of [Address]:
>
> ✓ Completed this week:
> - Mortgage application submitted
> - Appraisal scheduled for next Tuesday
> - 10% deposit received by seller's attorney
>
> → Coming up next week:
> - Appraisal on Tuesday (I'll meet appraiser at 2pm)
> - File moves to underwriting
> - Inspection scheduled for Thursday at 10am
>
> ⚠ Action items for you:
> - Respond to any requests from mortgage broker immediately
> - Be available for any underwriting questions
>
> Closing date: [Date] - on track!
>
> Let me know if you have any questions.
>
> [Your Name]

**Why this works:**
- Keeps buyer informed
- Shows you're on top of everything
- Reduces buyer anxiety
- Documents your diligence
- Prompts buyer action when needed

---

### Deadline Reminder Template

**Text/email to buyer:**

> Hi [Buyer], quick reminder: Your [ITEM] is due [DATE]. Please [SPECIFIC ACTION] by [TIME]. Let me know when done. Thanks!

**Examples:**

> "Hi John, quick reminder: Your 10% deposit ($50,000) is due Friday 3/15. Please wire to seller's attorney by Friday 5pm. Let me know when done. Thanks!"

> "Hi Sarah, quick reminder: Mortgage commitment deadline is Monday 4/1. I'm confirming with broker that commitment letter will be ready. Just keeping you in loop."

---

### Extension Request Script

**Call to listing agent:**

> "Hi [Listing Agent], I need to request a brief extension on our mortgage commitment deadline. The bank is waiting for one final piece of documentation from buyer's employer, which will arrive Monday. Can we extend the commitment date from Friday to Wednesday? I'll have my attorney send an amendment today."

**Why this works:**
- Professional courtesy call
- Explains reason (legitimate delay, not buyer issue)
- Proposes specific new date (not open-ended)
- Commits to formal written amendment
- Gives listing agent time to discuss with seller

## Common Timeline Problems

### Problem #1: Buyer Slow to Apply for Mortgage

**Red flags:**
- Week 1 ends, no application submitted
- Buyer "too busy" to gather documents
- Buyer keeps procrastinating

**Solution:**
- Daily follow-up with buyer
- Explain consequences: "If you miss mortgage commitment deadline, seller can cancel contract and keep deposit."
- Offer help: "What documents do you need? I can help you organize."
- Escalate: Contact mortgage broker to call buyer directly
- Last resort: Inform buyer's attorney (they can pressure buyer legally)

### Problem #2: Underwriting Delays

**Red flags:**
- Week 3, file not in underwriting yet
- Week 4, no commitment letter in sight
- Mortgage broker not responsive

**Solution:**
- Daily calls to mortgage broker
- Escalate to broker's manager
- Request realistic timeline
- If extension needed: Request EARLY (don't wait until day before deadline)
- Contact attorney to prepare extension request
- Inform listing agent professionally

### Problem #3: Seller Delays on Repairs

**Red flags:**
- Inspection identified needed repairs
- Seller agreed to make repairs
- Closing approaching, repairs not done

**Solution:**
- Weekly follow-up with listing agent: "Status on repairs?"
- Request proof of completion (photos, receipts)
- If not done by final walk-through: Hold funds in escrow or delay closing
- Buyer's attorney can require escrow holdback
- Don't close if repairs not completed (unless buyer agrees)

### Problem #4: Title Issues Surface Late

**Red flags:**
- Week 5, title company finds lien or issue
- Seller didn't disclose problem
- Resolution requires time

**Solution:**
- Order title work early (Regency Title benefit)
- If issue found late: Request closing extension
- Work with title company and attorneys to resolve
- Keep all parties informed
- May need seller to pay off lien at closing from proceeds

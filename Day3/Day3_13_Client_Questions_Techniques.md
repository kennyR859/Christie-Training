## The Dale Carnegie Principle

### Why Questions > Statements

**Dale Carnegie teaching:**
> "Bring a person to proper thinking through a series of questions"

**The psychology:**
- Questions engage the brain
- Statements create resistance
- Questions make people think
- Statements make people defend
- Questions uncover truth
- Statements impose beliefs

**Example:**

**Statement approach (weak):**
> "You should make an offer on this house. It's perfect for you."

**Question approach (strong):**
> "On a scale of 1-10, how do you feel about this house? What would it need to be a 10 for you?"

**Why questions work better:**
- Client evaluates honestly
- You learn what's missing
- Client feels heard
- No pressure
- Client reaches own conclusion

## The Non-Threatening Question Method

### What Makes a Question Non-Threatening?

**Characteristics:**
- Open-ended (not yes/no)
- Genuinely curious tone
- No implied judgment
- Allows any answer
- Shows interest in client, not just sale

**Threatening questions (avoid):**
- "Are you ready to make an offer?" (pressure)
- "Why haven't you bought yet?" (judgment)
- "Don't you think this is perfect?" (leading)
- "What's wrong with this house?" (negative)

**Non-threatening questions (use these):**
- "How do you feel about this property?"
- "What would make this perfect for you?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, where does this fall for you?"
- "What's most important to you in a home?"

## Buyer Consultation Questions

### Initial Phone Call

**When buyer calls about property:**

**1. Establish rapport:**
> "Hi! Thanks for calling. I'm [Your Name] with Christie's. What can I help you with today?"

**2. Property interest:**
> "Great! You're calling about [Address]. What caught your attention about this property?"

**3. Familiarity with area:**
> "Are you familiar with this area, or are you new to the neighborhood?"

**4. Timeline:**
> "How long have you been looking for a home?"

**5. The Regret Question (most powerful):**
> "In the time you've been looking, was there ever a home you saw that you regret you didn't buy?"

**Why the regret question matters:**
- Makes them relive the mistake
- They tell you exactly what they want
- Shows consequences of waiting
- Helps them act faster this time
- Uncovers decision-making process

**Follow up regret question:**
> "Why didn't you buy it?"
> "Do you think in retrospect you could have offered more?"

**6. Readiness to purchase:**
> "If I found you a home in your preferred area, are you ready to make an offer now, or are you still in the early stages?"

**7. Budget:**
> "What's your budget range?"
> OR (if they're hesitant): "What price range are you comfortable looking in?"

**8. Bedrooms/bathrooms:**
> "How many bedrooms are you looking for?"
> "How many bathrooms do you need?"

**9. Decision makers:**
> "Will anyone else be coming with you to see properties?"

**After they mention spouse/partner:**
> "Do you and [spouse] generally agree on the style of home you want, or do you have different preferences?"

**10. Must-haves:**
> "Besides bedrooms and bathrooms, what features are absolute must-haves for you?"

**11. Sell current home?:**
> "Do you have a home to sell first, or are you renting?"

**12. Why moving:**
> "What's prompting the move?"

**This uncovers:**
- Urgency (job transfer, family growing, etc.)
- Timeline
- Motivation level
- Potential challenges

### Fair Housing Compliance

**CRITICAL RULES:**

**You CANNOT ask:**
- ❌ "Do you have children?" (discriminatory)
- ❌ "What religion are you?" (discriminatory)
- ❌ "Where are you from?" (can imply national origin discrimination)
- ❌ "Are you planning to have children?" (familial status discrimination)

**You CAN ask (after THEY mention it):**
- ✅ "How old are your children?" (ONLY after they mention having kids)
- ✅ "What sports do they play?" (ONLY after they mention kids)
- ✅ "What grade are they in?" (ONLY after they mention kids)

**School questions:**

**CANNOT say:**
- ❌ "Ridge School is better than Orchard School"
- ❌ "This school is very diverse"
- ❌ "You'd prefer this school district"

**CAN say:**
- ✅ "Here's the state website with school ratings"
- ✅ "I know a parent in that school district - would you like their contact info?"
- ✅ "I recommend visiting the school yourself and speaking with the principal"

**Best practice:**
> "I can't make recommendations about schools because every family has different needs and priorities. I can provide you with public information - test scores, demographics, school websites - and I recommend visiting in person and speaking with the principal and teachers. Would that be helpful?"

### Real Discrimination Story

**From instructor:**

**Family looking at Randolph schools:**

**School #1 front desk:**
> Lady said: "You'll be better off in Roxbury, it's more diverse there."

**Translation:** She looked at their appearance and made assumptions about where they'd "fit in"

**School #2 (same district) middle school:**
> Lady looked them up and down, judging jewelry and appearance, wouldn't help them.

**School #3 - New Milford:**
> Principal came out immediately, very warm and inviting, answered all questions, made them feel welcome.

**Result:** Family chose New Milford based on how they were treated.

**Lesson:**
- Ignorance and discrimination exist everywhere
- Don't make assumptions about people
- Treat everyone with respect
- Provide information, let clients decide
- Your job: connect them with resources, not judge or steer

## During Property Showing

### Before Entering

**Curb appeal assessment:**
> "How do you feel about the curb appeal? First impressions?"

**This tells you:**
- Do they like exterior?
- Are they noticing details?
- Positive or negative initial reaction?

### While Showing

**Let them explore, then ask:**
- "What do you think of the layout?"
- "Can you see your furniture in this room?"
- "How does this compare to others you've seen?"
- "What stands out to you - positive or negative?"

**Kitchen:**
> "How important is the kitchen in your decision?"
> "Do you cook a lot, or is kitchen size less important?"

**Bedrooms:**
> "Can you picture your family in this space?"
> "Is the master bedroom size what you're looking for?"

**Backyard:**
> "What would you use this space for?"
> "Is yard size important to you?"

### Before Leaving Property

**The favor request:**
> "I have a favor to ask. When we exit, I want you to tell me everything you DISLIKED about this house. And also everything you liked. Can you do that for me?"

**Why this works:**
- Gives them permission to be honest
- They won't feel rude criticizing
- You get real feedback
- Can address concerns immediately
- Or know to move on to next property

**After they share:**
- "Thank you for being honest"
- Don't defend the property
- Don't argue with their concerns
- Ask clarifying questions to understand
- Use feedback to refine search

---

## The Rating Scale Question

### The 1-10 Scale

**After showing:**
> "So on a scale of 1-10, how do you feel about this house?"

**Responses and follow-ups:**

**1-3 (Not interested):**
> "What specifically didn't work for you?"
> (Learn what to avoid in future showings)

**4-6 (Lukewarm):**
> "What would it take to make this an 8 or 9 for you?"
> (Uncover what's missing)

**7-8 (Strong interest):**
> "Is this a home we should keep on our 'perhaps' list?"
> "What would make it a 10?"

**9-10 (Love it):**
> "Is this a home you'd consider making an offer on?"
> "What do we need to do next?"

**The power of the scale:**
- Quantifies interest
- Non-threatening way to ask
- Opens conversation
- Identifies obstacles
- Shows progression

---

## Asking for the Sale

### Don't Avoid This Question

**Many agents afraid to ask:**
- Fear of rejection
- Don't want to seem pushy
- Uncomfortable with directness
- Wait for client to decide

**Result:**
- Buyer never commits
- Opportunity lost
- Another agent gets the sale
- Months of work wasted

### How to Ask Without Pressure

**After buyer rates 9-10:**
> "Is this a home you'd like to make an offer on?"

**If buyer hesitates:**
> "What's holding you back? Let's talk through it."

**Common concerns:**
- "I want to see a few more first" → "That's smart. What are you hoping to find that this doesn't have?"
- "I need to think about it" → "Of course. What specifically do you need to think through? Maybe I can provide information to help."
- "I want to show my [parent/friend]" → "Absolutely. When can they see it? Should we schedule another showing?"

## The Power of Silence

### After Asking Question

**Technique:**
1. Ask important question
2. Stop talking
3. Wait for answer
4. Don't fill silence
5. Let client think and respond

**Example:**

**You:** "On a scale of 1-10, how do you feel about this house?"

**Silence (5-10 seconds while they think)**

**Client:** "I'd say an 8. I love the layout and location, but I'm concerned about the kitchen size."

**Wrong response:**
> "Oh the kitchen is actually quite functional, many people love galley kitchens, you could remodel it, it has great potential..." (defensive, talking over their concern)

**Right response:**
> "Tell me more about your kitchen concerns. How do you use your kitchen? What would be ideal?" (more questions, listening)

**Why silence works:**
- Shows you're listening
- Gives client time to think
- Prevents you from talking them out of interest
- Lets them talk themselves into decision
- Builds trust

## Overcoming Objections with Questions

### Objection: "I want to think about it"

**Bad response:**
> "But this won't last! You need to decide now!"

**Good response (questions):**
> "Of course, this is a big decision. Can I ask - what specifically do you want to think through? Maybe I can provide information that would help."

**Then:**
- Listen to their answer
- Address specific concerns with more questions
- "How important is [concern] compared to [feature they loved]?"
- Guide them to logical conclusion

### Objection: "It's too expensive"

**Bad response:**
> "But look at all the features! It's worth it!"

**Good response (questions):**
> "I understand budget is important. Can I ask - is it the monthly payment you're concerned about, or the purchase price?"

**If monthly payment:**
> "What monthly payment would be comfortable for you? Let me show you what purchase price that translates to, and we can search in that range."

**If purchase price:**
> "What price range feels right? Let's look at comparable homes in that range and see how they compare to this one."

### Objection: "I want to see more homes first"

**Bad response:**
> "You've already seen 20 houses! You'll never find perfect!"

**Good response (questions):**
> "That's smart to be thorough. What are you hoping to find that you haven't seen yet? Help me understand what would make you say 'this is the one.'"

**Follow up:**
> "Of the homes you've seen, which has been closest to what you want?"
> "What did that one have that others didn't?"
> "What was it missing?"

**Then:** Use answers to refine search or show them they've already found it

## Building Rapport Through Questions

### Show Genuine Interest

**Personal questions (appropriate):**
- "What do you do for work?" (ONLY if they seem open to it)
- "How long have you lived in the area?"
- "What do you like to do for fun?"
- "What's your favorite restaurant around here?"

**Why this matters:**
- People want to work with people who care about them
- Builds relationship beyond transaction
- Creates loyalty
- Generates referrals
- Makes you memorable

**Dale Carnegie principle:**
> "Be genuinely interested in other people"

**Application:**
- Ask about their lives
- Remember details
- Follow up on previous conversations
- Send birthday cards
- Care about them as people, not commissions

---

## The Showing Debrief Questions

### After Each Showing

**In the car:**
> "Quick thoughts - what did you like, what didn't you like?"

**End of day:**
> "Of the 4 homes we saw today, which was your favorite?"
> "Why?"
> "Which was your least favorite?"
> "Why?"
> "Are any of these homes you'd want to see again?"

**This tells you:**
- What features matter most
- What they can compromise on
- If you're on right track
- How to refine search

## Summary

**Question-based selling works because:**
- Questions engage thinking
- Statements create resistance
- Questions uncover needs
- Statements impose solutions
- Questions build trust
- Statements create pressure

**Critical questions to master:**
- The regret question (was there a home you regret not buying?)
- The 1-10 scale (how do you feel about this house?)
- The favor request (tell me what you disliked and liked)
- The readiness question (are you ready to make an offer?)

**Fair housing compliance:**
- Never ask about children, religion, national origin first
- Only ask follow-up questions after they mention
- Provide school data, don't make recommendations
- Treat everyone with respect

**The power of listening:**
- Ask question, then be silent
- Let client think and respond
- Don't fill silence with talking
- Listen to understand, not to respond

**Remember:** Every interaction should be a conversation built on questions, not a presentation built on statements. Questions sell homes, statements create objections.

# Day 3 - Topic 03: Contract Line-by-Line Guide

## Overview
Understanding every line of the real estate contract is essential for protecting your clients and avoiding costly mistakes. This guide walks through critical contract lines 43-78+ with practical explanations and best practices.

---

## Purchase Price Section

### Line 43: Purchase Price

**What it is:**
- Total offering price for the property
- Auto-fills from earlier entry in contract
- The number everyone focuses on

**Key points:**
- Should match pre-approval amount or buyer's budget
- Consider appraisal risk if significantly over asking
- Round numbers often work better ($500,000 vs $497,500)

---

## Deposit Structure

### Line 45: Initial Deposit

**CRITICAL:**
> **CROSS THIS OUT** - Not used anymore

**Why we don't use it:**
- Law requires deposit within 24 hours if line is filled in
- Creates unnecessary complications
- If deal needs renegotiation during attorney review, money already deposited
- Would need to deposit, then potentially withdraw and re-deposit
- Adds friction to process

**What to do:**
- Draw line through Line 45
- Skip to Line 46 (Additional Deposit)
- This is standard practice now

---

### Line 46: Additional Deposit

**This is your REAL first deposit**

**Traditional amount:**
- **10% of purchase price** (standard)
- Example: $500K house = $50K deposit

**Variations by loan type:**
- **Conventional (10-20% down):** Usually 10% deposit
- **FHA (3.5% down):** Often 3% deposit (still significant for buyer)
- **VA (0% down):** Varies, often 5-10% deposit despite no down payment required
- **Cash buyers:** Often 10%+ to show strength

**Strategic considerations:**

**Stronger offer:**
- Increase deposit to 15% or 20%
- Shows financial capability
- Demonstrates commitment
- Makes seller feel secure

**Weaker financial position:**
- Minimum 3-5% for FHA/VA
- Explain in cover letter
- Strengthen other terms (quick close, etc.)

**Where it goes:**
- Escrow account of seller's attorney
- Can be interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing
- Interest typically goes to buyer
- Protected until closing

---

### Line 48: Balance of Purchase Price

**What it is:**
- Remaining down payment beyond Line 46 deposit
- The rest of buyer's cash contribution

**Example calculation:**

**Scenario: $500,000 purchase, 20% down ($100,000 total)**
- Line 46 (Additional Deposit): $50,000 (10%)
- Line 48 (Balance): $50,000 (10%)
- Total down payment: $100,000 (20%)
- Mortgage: $400,000 (80%)

**Scenario: $500,000 purchase, FHA 3.5% down ($17,500 total)**
- Line 46 (Additional Deposit): $15,000 (3%)
- Line 48 (Balance): $2,500 (0.5%)
- Total down payment: $17,500 (3.5%)
- Mortgage: $482,500 (96.5%)

**When balance is due:**
- At closing
- Certified check or wire transfer
- Verified days before closing

---

### Line 51: Manner of Payment

**What to do:**
> **CROSS THIS OUT** - Not used

**Why:**
- Outdated contract language
- Payment manner covered in other sections
- Skip this line entirely

---

## Deposit Timing Details

### Line 56: When Additional Deposit is Due

**Three options:**

**1. Default language (don't use):**
> "Within 10 business days after fully signed contract"

**Problem:** 10 days is too long, allows buyer to change mind

**2. Better option:**
> "Within 1 day after attorney review period"

**Why better:**
- Attorney review is 3 business days
- Gives lawyers time to negotiate
- Buyer committed after review period
- Faster timeline

**3. BEST option (makes offer stronger):**
> "AVAILABLE within 1 day after attorney review is completed"
>
> Then in Line 721 (Additional Contractual Provisions) add:
>
> "BUYER WILL DEPOSIT 10% IMMEDIATELY AFTER ATTORNEY REVIEW IS COMPLETED"

**Why this is strongest:**
- "Available" means buyer HAS the money ready
- "Will deposit immediately" shows commitment
- Seller feels secure
- Demonstrates financial strength
- Can be deciding factor in multiple offer situation

---

## Mortgage Contingency Section

### Lines 60-66: Critical Mortgage Details

**Purpose:**
- Protects buyer if can't get financing
- Specifies loan terms
- Sets timeline for commitment

**If buyer needs mortgage, this section is CRITICAL**

**Key elements to fill in:**

**1. Principal Amount (Line 60)**
- How much buyer is borrowing
- Example: $500K purchase - $100K down = $400K principal

**2. Type of Mortgage (Line 61)**
- FHA
- VA
- 203K
- Conventional
- Assumable (rare)

**3. Term (Line 62)**
- Usually 30 years
- Sometimes 20 or 15 years (higher monthly payment, less interest)
- ARM options (adjustable rate mortgage) - rare now

**4. Monthly Payment Calculation (Line 63)**
- Based on what term?
- Usually based on 30-year term
- Includes principal + interest (not taxes/insurance in this line)

---

## Special Mortgage Types

### 203K Loan: "Buy It, Fix It" Mortgage

**What it is:**
- FHA-backed renovation loan
- Bank lends for purchase price + repair costs
- Buyer can buy fixer-upper without cash for repairs

**How it works:**
1. Buyer finds property needing repairs
2. Gets 203K pre-approval for purchase + repairs
3. Provides repair estimate to lender
4. Bank approves total amount
5. Repairs must be completed post-closing
6. Bank inspects at each stage of repair
7. Releases funds incrementally

**Requirements:**
- Town inspector approval at each stage
- Bank inspector approval at each stage
- Coordination between both inspectors
- Contractor must be approved/licensed

**Timeline:**
- Much longer than conventional
- 60-90 days typical
- Seller must be patient
- Buyer must be organized

**When to use:**
- Buyer has down payment but no repair funds
- Property needs significant work (roof, HVAC, etc.)
- Property may not qualify for conventional loan as-is
- Buyer is committed to renovation project

**Challenges:**
- Time-consuming
- Requires two inspections per stage
- Seller must agree to longer timeline
- Not all properties qualify

---

### Assumable Mortgage

**What it is:**
- Buyer takes over seller's existing mortgage
- Keeps seller's interest rate and terms
- Rare in current market

**Why rare:**
- Most mortgages have "due on sale" clause
- Seller's rate often not advantageous
- Example: If seller has 3% rate, sounds great
  - But buyer needs second mortgage for down payment
  - Second mortgage at 7-8% rate
  - Blended rate ends up similar to new mortgage
  - Added complexity not worth it

**When it might work:**
- Seller has very old VA loan (no due on sale clause)
- Seller has large equity (buyer only assumes small mortgage)
- Seller offering owner financing for balance
- Very specific situations

**Usually not worth the effort in current market**

---

## Mortgage Timeline

### Line 78: Mortgage Commitment Date

**What it means:**
- Date by which buyer must obtain commitment letter from bank
- Usually 30 days from end of attorney review
- HARD deadline - deal can die if missed

**What must be completed by this date:**

1. **Buyer applied for mortgage** (Week 1)
   - Submitted all paperwork
   - Bank pulled credit
   - Verification of employment
   - Bank statements provided

2. **Appraisal ordered and completed** (Week 2-3)
   - Appraiser contacted
   - Property inspected
   - Comps researched
   - Report submitted to bank

3. **Underwriting review** (Week 3-4)
   - All documents verified
   - Any questions answered
   - Conditions cleared

4. **Commitment letter issued** (Week 4)
   - Bank's written promise to lend
   - States loan amount, rate, terms
   - May include conditions (must be cleared before closing)

## YOUR CRITICAL JOB: Timeline Management

### Put EVERYTHING in Your Calendar

**Instructor's warning:**
> "Put all timeline dates in your phone calendar with reminders! Every date should be in your phone. Don't rely on attorney, listing agent, or anyone else. You are responsible."

**What to calendar:**
- Attorney review period end date
- Deposit due date
- Mortgage application deadline
- Appraisal deadline
- Mortgage commitment date
- Inspection contingency deadline
- Closing date
- Any other contractual deadlines

**Set multiple reminders:**
- 7 days before
- 3 days before
- 1 day before
- Day of deadline

---

### Follow-Up Sequence for Mortgage

**Week 1:**
- Call buyer: "Did you apply for the mortgage?"
- Call mortgage broker: "Did [buyer] submit application?"
- Confirm all paperwork submitted

**Week 2:**
- Call mortgage broker: "Has appraiser been scheduled?"
- If yes: "When is appointment?"
- If no: "Why not? When will it be scheduled?"
- Offer to meet appraiser at property

**Week 3:**
- Call mortgage broker: "Has appraisal been completed?"
- "Is file in underwriting yet?"
- "Any questions or missing documents?"
- Get status update

**Week 4:**
- Call mortgage broker: "Where are we with commitment letter?"
- "Any conditions that need to be cleared?"
- "Will we make the deadline?"
- If running late: IMMEDIATE action required

---

### If Running Late on Mortgage Commitment

**IMMEDIATE steps:**

1. **Call attorney** same day you realize problem
   - Explain situation
   - Request extension in writing
   - Don't wait

2. **Notify seller's attorney**
   - Professional courtesy
   - Explain delay reason
   - Propose new deadline

3. **Call listing agent**
   - Explain situation honestly
   - Reassure seller
   - Maintain good relationship

4. **Document everything**
   - Email trail
   - Written amendment to contract
   - Signed by both parties

**Critical warning:**
> "If you don't meet mortgage commitment date, deal is dead in water. Seller can walk away. If there's backup offer, they might take it."

**Why this matters:**
- Seller may have purchased another home
- Seller's closing date depends on your buyer
- Seller could lose THEIR deal if yours falls through
- Domino effect of broken commitments

## Best Practices

### Before Submitting Offer

**Verify buyer's readiness:**
- [ ] Pre-approval letter current (within 30 days)
- [ ] Proof of funds for down payment + deposit
- [ ] Buyer knows deposit amount required
- [ ] Buyer has selected mortgage broker/lender
- [ ] Timeline is realistic for buyer's situation

### During Contract Period

**Stay on top of deadlines:**
- [ ] Calendar all dates immediately
- [ ] Weekly check-ins with buyer
- [ ] Weekly check-ins with mortgage broker
- [ ] Bi-weekly check-ins with attorney
- [ ] Document all communications

### Communication Strategy

**With buyer:**
- "Just checking in on your mortgage application. Have you submitted everything to the bank?"

**With mortgage broker:**
- "Hi [broker], just following up on [buyer]'s file. Where are we in the process?"

**With attorney:**
- "Did you receive the 10% deposit? Can you confirm?"

**Two to three checkpoints for every deadline:**
1. Remind client to do it
2. Confirm client did it
3. Confirm receiving party got it

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Assuming Someone Else is Tracking

**Real story:**
> "New agent reminded buyer to deliver 10%. Wife said husband would do it tomorrow. Agent never checked again. At closing, 10% was never delivered. Had to run out and get it. Very embarrassing."

**Lesson:**
- Never assume
- Always verify
- Check with receiving party
- Document confirmation

### Mistake #2: Not Reading Pre-Approval Carefully

**Problems:**
- Pre-approval amount is less than purchase price
- Pre-approval is expired
- Pre-approval is conditional on selling current home
- Pre-approval is from weak lender

**Solution:**
- Read entire pre-approval letter
- Verify amount covers purchase + closing costs
- Check expiration date
- Verify lender is reputable

### Mistake #3: Wrong Deposit Amount

**Example:**
- Buyer writes $5,000 on Line 46
- Should be 10% ($50,000)
- Seller's attorney catches it
- Looks like buyer can't afford property
- Weakens entire offer

**Prevention:**
- Double-check math
- Verify with buyer before submitting
- Standard is 10% unless good reason

### Mistake #4: Unrealistic Timeline

**Example:**
- 203K loan (needs 60+ days)
- Contract sets 30-day commitment
- Impossible to meet
- Deal falls apart

**Prevention:**
- Know loan type timelines
- FHA/VA: 30-45 days
- 203K: 60-90 days
- Conventional: 30-40 days
- Adjust contract accordingly

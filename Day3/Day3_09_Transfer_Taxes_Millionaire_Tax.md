## The Millionaire's Tax: Recent Changes

### Old Rule (Before Recent Change)

**Original Millionaire's Tax:**
- **Buyer paid** 1% on any home over $1 million
- Applied to purchase price over $1M
- Example: $1.5M home = $5,000 tax (1% of $500K over $1M)
- Paid by buyer at closing
- Controversial but straightforward

### New Rule (Current)

**Major change:**
> **Seller now pays** on sliding scale based on price tiers

**New tiered structure:**

**$1M - $2M:**
- Seller pays at one rate
- Different from over $2M

**$2M - $2.5M:**
- Higher rate
- Increasing burden on seller

**$2.5M - $3M:**
- Higher still
- Significant tax

**$3M - $3.5M:**
- 3% consideration rate
- Very substantial

**Over $3.5M:**
- 3% consideration rate continues
- Major impact on ultra-luxury market

**Example calculation (verify with attorney):**
- $3.2M sale price
- Millionaire's Tax tier: 3% consideration
- Tax could be $30,000+ (depending on exact tier calculation)
- Plus standard transfer tax
- Total transfer taxes could exceed $40,000

## Impact on Luxury Market

### Hitting Sellers Hard

**Why this matters:**
- Seller expected one amount for proceeds
- New tax significantly reduces net
- Surprise to sellers who haven't sold recently
- Must factor into pricing strategy

**Instructor's note:**
> "Hitting luxury market hard. Sellers now responsible. Must factor into net proceeds."

### Pricing Strategy Implications

**For listing agent:**

**Old approach:**
- Price at $3.5M
- Seller nets $3.5M minus standard costs

**New approach:**
- Price at $3.5M
- Seller pays 3% Millionaire's Tax ($105,000)
- Plus standard transfer tax
- Plus real estate commissions
- Plus other closing costs
- Net proceeds significantly reduced

**Must discuss with seller:**
> "Your property will likely sell for around $3.2M based on comps. However, because it's over $3M, you'll pay the Millionaire's Tax at 3% consideration, which is approximately $32,000, plus standard transfer taxes of approximately $X, plus our commission of $Y. Your estimated net proceeds after all costs will be $Z. Are you comfortable with this number?"

### Market Reaction

**What's happening:**
- Some sellers raising prices to compensate
- Some sellers accepting lower net proceeds
- Some buyers pushing back on higher prices
- Market finding new equilibrium

**Buyer impact:**
- Not directly paying Millionaire's Tax anymore
- But sellers may price higher to compensate
- Net effect: prices may adjust upward

## Calculating Seller's Net Proceeds

### The Formula

**Gross Sale Price**
- Minus: Real estate commissions (typically 5-6%)
- Minus: Standard transfer tax
- Minus: Millionaire's Tax (if applicable)
- Minus: Attorney fees
- Minus: Outstanding mortgage payoff
- Minus: Outstanding liens (if any)
- Minus: Seller's concessions (if any)
- Minus: Prorated property taxes
- Minus: HOA fees (if applicable)
= **Net Proceeds to Seller**

### Example: $500,000 Sale

**Sale Price:** $500,000

**Deductions:**
- Commission (6%): -$30,000
- Transfer tax (~1.5%, varies): -$7,500
- Attorney fees: -$1,500
- Mortgage payoff: -$300,000
- Prorated taxes: -$2,000

**Estimated Net:** $159,000

### Example: $3,200,000 Sale

**Sale Price:** $3,200,000

**Deductions:**
- Commission (5%): -$160,000
- Standard transfer tax (~1.5%): -$48,000
- Millionaire's Tax (3% consideration): -$96,000 (approximate)
- Attorney fees: -$3,000
- Mortgage payoff: -$1,500,000
- Prorated taxes: -$15,000

**Estimated Net:** $1,378,000

**Key point:** Millionaire's Tax of $96,000 is significant expense seller must plan for

## Disclosure to Clients

### To Sellers (Listing Presentation)

**Bring calculator or prepared worksheet:**

> "Let's talk about your estimated net proceeds. Your home should sell for approximately $[Price]. Here's what you'll pay at closing:
>
> - Real estate commission: $X (our standard rate)
> - Transfer taxes: $Y (New Jersey requires this)
> - Millionaire's Tax: $Z (because the property is over $[threshold])
> - Attorney fees: approximately $A
> - Mortgage payoff: $B
> - Other costs: $C
>
> Your estimated net proceeds: $[Total]
>
> Does this number work for your plans?"

**Why this is critical:**
- Seller must know true net BEFORE listing
- Prevents shock at closing
- Allows seller to make informed decision
- Builds trust through transparency

### To Buyers (Luxury Market)

**Explain the change:**

> "Good news for you: New Jersey recently changed the Millionaire's Tax. It used to be that buyers paid 1% on homes over $1 million. Now sellers pay on a sliding scale, so you're not paying that extra 1%. However, sellers may price their homes slightly higher to compensate for this new tax burden."

**Set expectations:**
- Buyer saves the old 1% buyer tax
- But market may have adjusted prices upward
- Net effect may be neutral

## Negotiation Strategies

### When Seller Wants to Net Specific Amount

**Scenario:**
- Seller needs $2M net to buy next home
- Property worth approximately $2.8M
- How to price?

**Back-calculation:**
1. Seller wants: $2,000,000 net
2. Add back costs:
   - Commission (5%): Need $140,000
   - Transfer taxes: Need ~$60,000
   - Millionaire's Tax: Need ~$60,000
   - Attorney: Need $3,000
   - Total costs: ~$263,000
3. Seller needs: $2,263,000 sale price minimum
4. Price property at: $2,350,000 (with negotiation room)

**Present to seller:**
> "To net $2M after all costs including the new Millionaire's Tax, we need to price at approximately $2.35M and negotiate from there. Does this work for you?"

### When Buyer Objects to High Price

**Buyer says:**
> "This property is overpriced compared to the one down the street."

**Explain (if true):**
> "The seller is factoring in the new Millionaire's Tax, which is a significant cost they didn't have to pay before. The market is adjusting to this new tax structure. However, I'll present your offer and we'll see what they say."

**Don't:**
- Blame seller for greed
- Over-explain tax policy
- Make buyer feel they're paying the tax
- Get into political discussions

---

## Multiple Offer Situations

### Tax Impact on Seller's Decision

**Scenario: Three offers on $2.9M property**

- **Offer A:** $2.9M, conventional, 30-day close
- **Offer B:** $2.85M, cash, 15-day close
- **Offer C:** $3.0M, FHA, 45-day close, inspection contingencies

**Seller's net calculation includes:**
- Millionaire's Tax on each price
- Commission on each price
- Risk factors (contingencies, timeline)

**Example:**
- Offer A ($2.9M): Seller nets ~$1.8M
- Offer B ($2.85M): Seller nets ~$1.78M (slightly less but certain/fast)
- Offer C ($3.0M): Seller nets ~$1.85M (but higher risk, longer timeline)

**Your advice to buyer:**
- Understand seller's net proceeds calculation
- Sometimes lower price with better terms wins
- Clean offer may beat higher but risky offer

## What You CANNOT Disclose

### Buyer's Confidential Information

**Financial information:**
- "We'll offer $500K but can go to $550K if needed"
- Buyer inherited money
- Buyer has significant savings
- Buyer's maximum budget
- Pre-approval amount exceeds asking price

**Personal circumstances:**
- Buyer is getting divorced
- Buyer lost job and needs to move
- Buyer's financial distress or desperation
- Family situations causing move
- Health issues
- Job transfers

**Negotiation strategy:**
- Buyer's true bottom line
- Buyer's motivation level
- Buyer's alternative options
- Buyer's timeline flexibility

### Seller's Confidential Information

**Financial motivation:**
- Seller must sell fast (foreclosure threat)
- Seller behind on mortgage payments
- Seller facing bankruptcy
- Job transfer requiring quick sale
- Seller's bottom-line price

**Personal circumstances:**
- Divorce requiring sale
- Health issues
- Death in family
- Financial distress
- Relocation timeline

**Example of what NOT to say:**
> ❌ "The seller is desperate - they just lost their job and need to move in 30 days."
>
> ❌ "The buyer can go higher - they inherited $2 million."

## The Gray Area: Multiple Offers

### What You Can Say

**If representing seller:**
- "We have multiple offers"
- "Please submit your highest and best"
- "Offers will be reviewed at [specific time]"

**What you CANNOT say:**
- Specific offer amounts
- Number of offers (some agents debate this)
- Details about competing buyers
- "You need to offer $X to win"

### Dual Agency Complications

**If representing both sides:**
- Cannot disclose buyer's max to seller
- Cannot disclose seller's minimum to buyer
- Must remain neutral
- **This is why designated agency is better**

---

## Escalation Clauses: The Confidentiality Problem

### What is an Escalation Clause?

**Definition:**
> "I will pay $X more than any other offer" or "I will pay up to $20,000 more than the highest offer, up to a maximum of $550,000"

**How it works:**
- Buyer submits offer with escalation clause
- If competing offer comes in, buyer's offer automatically increases
- Buyer pays slightly more than highest competing offer

### The Confidentiality Problem

**The issue:**
- To trigger escalation clause, listing agent must show buyer the competing contract
- This breaches confidentiality of the other offer
- Other buyer's offer details should be confidential
- Creates legal gray area

**Example:**
- Offer A: $500K with escalation clause (will go $5K over any offer, up to $550K max)
- Offer B: $520K firm
- To prove escalation, listing agent shows Offer B to Buyer A
- Buyer B's confidential offer is now disclosed

### Current Legal Status

**History:**
- MLS once banned escalation clauses
- Later allowed them again
- Still legal (for now)
- Many listing agents refuse them
- Likely to become court case soon

**Industry practice:**
- Some listing agents reject escalation clauses outright
- Others accept but require full contract disclosure
- Creates inconsistency in market

### Recommendation

**Instructor's advice:**
> "Steer away from escalation clauses. If buyer insists, prepare for listing agent to reject it or demand full contract disclosure."

**Better alternatives:**
1. **Ask buyer their true max and submit highest offer first**
2. **Submit strong initial offer with shorter expiration** (pressure tactic)
3. **Include personal letter to seller**
4. **Make offer attractive in other ways** (flexible closing, no inspection contingency if appropriate)

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Buyer Asks About Seller's Motivation

**Buyer:** "Why is the seller moving? Are they desperate?"

**Wrong answer:**
> ❌ "Yes, they lost their job and need to sell fast."

**Correct answer:**
> ✅ "I'm not at liberty to discuss the seller's personal situation. What I can tell you is the property has been on market for X days, and the seller is reviewing offers on [date]."

### Scenario 2: Seller Asks About Buyer's Finances

**Seller:** "Can the buyer afford more? What's their max?"

**Wrong answer:**
> ❌ "They're pre-approved for $600K, so they can definitely go higher."

**Correct answer:**
> ✅ "The buyer has provided proof of pre-approval for the offer amount. I cannot discuss their financial details beyond what's needed to demonstrate they're qualified."

### Scenario 3: Listing Agent Asks Your Buyer's Max

**Listing agent:** "What's your buyer's top number? We have other offers."

**Wrong answer:**
> ❌ "She can go to $550K if needed."

**Correct answer:**
> ✅ "My offer stands as submitted. If your seller wants to counter, we'll review it. Otherwise, please let me know if we're in consideration."

### Scenario 4: Buyer Asks If They're the Only Offer

**Buyer:** "Are there other offers? How many?"

**If you represent buyer:**
> ✅ "I don't have that information yet. I'll reach out to the listing agent to inquire about the offer situation."

**After speaking to listing agent:**
> ✅ "The listing agent indicated there are multiple offers" (only if listing agent disclosed this to you)
>
> OR
>
> ✅ "The listing agent couldn't disclose the number of offers, but they're requesting highest and best by tomorrow."

## When Confidentiality Ends

### After Transaction Closes

**General rule:**
- Most confidential information remains confidential forever
- Exception: Information that becomes public record

**What becomes public:**
- Final sale price (recorded deed)
- Property taxes
- Lot size, deed restrictions
- Mortgage amount (if recorded)

**Still confidential after closing:**
- Negotiation details
- Personal circumstances
- Financial details beyond public record
- Inspection issues that were resolved

### When Client Releases You

**Written permission:**
- Client can authorize you to disclose specific information
- Must be in writing
- Should specify exactly what can be disclosed
- Good practice: Get this in email for documentation

---

## Special Situations

### Divorce Sales

**Extra sensitivity required:**
- Often contentious
- Both spouses may be clients
- Cannot take sides
- Cannot disclose one spouse's comments to the other
- Designated agency highly recommended

### Short Sales & Foreclosures

**Bank involvement:**
- Can discuss with bank (with seller permission)
- Bank needs financial hardship explanation
- Seller's attorney handles most sensitive information

### Estate Sales

**Multiple decision-makers:**
- Siblings or executors may have different goals
- Cannot disclose internal family disagreements
- Present united front to buyers
- Let attorney mediate family issues

---

## Best Practices

### Documentation

1. **Keep records of all communications**
   - Emails
   - Text messages
   - Phone call notes
   - Meeting minutes

2. **Use confidentiality agreements**
   - Include in buyer/seller agreements
   - Review at first meeting
   - Remind clients periodically

3. **When in doubt, don't disclose**

   - Consult broker
   - Consult attorney if needed

### Communication Tips

- Explain confidentiality obligations at first meeting
- Remind them what you can/cannot share
- Document their authorization for any disclosures

**With other agents:**
- Be professional but guarded
- Don't share unnecessary information

- "Between you and me..."
- "Don't tell anyone, but..."
- "They told me their max is..."
- "The seller will take less because..."

**If you catch yourself:**

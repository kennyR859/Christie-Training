# Day 3 - Topic 14: Role Playing & Practice Guide

## Overview
Role playing is the bridge between knowledge and skill. You can read about objection handling and contracts, but until you practice delivering responses out loud, handling difficult scenarios, and receiving feedback, you won't be prepared for real clients. This guide provides role-play frameworks, scenarios, and practice techniques to build confidence and competence.

## Why Role Playing Matters

### The Learning Gap

**What training gives you:**
- Knowledge (5-10% retention)
- Understanding of concepts
- Awareness of what to do

**What role playing gives you:**
- Skill (75% retention)
- Confidence in delivery
- Muscle memory
- Error correction
- Real-world readiness

**Analogy:**
- Reading about swimming ≠ Being able to swim
- Reading about objection handling ≠ Being able to handle objections
- **You must practice**

---

## Using ChatGPT for Practice

### The AI Role Play Partner

**Instructor's recommendation:**
> "Use ChatGPT: 'I'm a brand new listing agent. Give me all the objections a seller could make and answers to those objections.'"

**How to use ChatGPT effectively:**

**1. Generate objections:**
> "I'm a new real estate agent. Give me 20 common seller objections during a listing presentation."

**ChatGPT provides:**
- "Your commission is too high"
- "I want to try selling it myself first"
- "Other agents charge less"
- "The market is bad right now"
- Etc.

**2. Get suggested responses:**
> "For each objection, provide a professional response I can practice."

**3. Practice delivery:**
- Read objection out loud
- Give your response out loud
- Compare to ChatGPT suggestion
- Refine your response
- Practice again

**4. Advanced practice:**
> "Now play the role of a difficult seller. I'll respond to your objections. Be challenging."

Then have conversation with ChatGPT, practicing in real-time.

**Buyer:** "It's in our price range and has 4 bedrooms."

**Agent:** "Great! Are you familiar with this neighborhood, or new to the area?"

**Buyer:** "We've been looking for about 2 years, so we know it well."

**Agent:** "Thank you for inviting me to present today. Before I show you my marketing plan, can I ask - what's most important to you in choosing an agent?"

**Seller:** "I want the highest price and fastest sale."

**Agent:** "That makes perfect sense. Can I ask - have you sold a home before?"

**Seller:** "Yes, 10 years ago. We listed with a friend who's an agent."

**Agent:** "How was that experience?"

**Seller:** "It was okay, but it took 6 months to sell and we had to drop the price twice."

**Agent:** "I'm sorry to hear that. What would you want to be different this time?"

**Continue practicing:**

**Buyer:** "It's nice, better than the last one."

**Inside:**

**Agent:** (Let buyer explore, then ask) "What do you think of the layout?"

**Buyer:** "I like the open concept, but the kitchen seems small."

**Agent:** "How important is kitchen size in your decision?"

**Buyer:** "Pretty important - we cook a lot."

**Agent:** "Got it. On a scale of 1-10, where would you rate this kitchen?"

**Before leaving:**

**Agent:** "I have a favor to ask. Can you tell me everything you liked and disliked about this house?"

**Buyer:** (Provides honest feedback)

**Agent:** "Thank you for being honest. Based on what you've shared, should we look at homes with larger kitchens as a priority?"

### Scenario 4: Handling Objections

**Setup:**
- Practice handling common objections
- Partner throws objections
- You respond with questions and techniques

**Common objections to practice:**

**Objection 1: "I want to think about it"**

**Weak response:**
> "But this won't last! You need to decide now!"

**Practice response:**
> "Of course, this is a big decision. Can I ask - what specifically do you want to think through? Maybe I can provide information that would help."

---

**Objection 2: "Your commission is too high"**

**Weak response:**
> "That's the standard rate, everyone charges this."

**Practice response:**
> "I understand commission is a significant expense. Can I show you what my marketing plan includes and how I'll get you the highest price? My goal is to net you more money even after commission than you'd get at a lower commission with less marketing."

---

**Objection 3: "I want to see a few more homes first"**

**Weak response:**
> "You've already seen 20 houses! You'll never find perfect!"

**Practice response:**
> "That's smart to be thorough. What are you hoping to find that this house doesn't have? Help me understand what would make you say 'this is the one.'"

- Try different responses
- Record yourself
- Listen back
- Refine delivery

- **Buyer (partner):** Nervous, lots of questions

**Practice script:**

**Buyer:** "I've never bought a house before. Where do we even start?"

**Agent:** "Congratulations on taking this step! Let me walk you through the process. First question: Have you spoken with a mortgage lender yet?"

**Buyer:** "No, I don't know if I'd even qualify."

**Agent:** "That's the perfect place to start. I work with several excellent lenders who can pre-approve you and tell you exactly what you qualify for. Would you like me to introduce you to one?"

**Continue practicing:**
- Explaining pre-approval process

## Recording and Self-Review

### The Mirror Technique

**Why record yourself:**
- Hear how you actually sound (not how you think you sound)
- Identify filler words ("um," "like," "you know")
- Catch nervous habits
- Improve pacing and tone
- Build confidence through repetition

**How to practice:**

**1. Set up phone to record**

**2. Deliver presentation/response:**
- Listing presentation
- Buyer consultation
- Objection response
- Contract explanation

**3. Watch/listen back:**
- Did you sound confident?
- Too fast? Too slow?
- Monotone or engaging?
- Clear or confusing?
- Professional or unsure?

**4. Identify improvements:**
- "I said 'um' 12 times"
- "I talked too fast"
- "I didn't make eye contact with camera"
- "I forgot to ask for the sale"

**5. Practice again:**
- Focus on improvements
- Record again
- Compare to first version
- Repeat until polished

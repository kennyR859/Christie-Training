Sometimes I get people get into more trouble with that because both people want you and the one that you have to give to another person sometimes feels betrayed or feels like oh how come how come how come not me why aren't you representing me so it's a it's a very fine line it's unfortunate that this has all created sometimes Sometimes good laws create problems An example of that is I forgot what year it was The state of New Jersey upped the drinking age and it was to stop teenagers car accidents and whatever and people driving drunk So what happened there were more car accidents because young teenagers and college kids drove right over the border to Rockland County which the age was still 18 you know so it was a good law Unfortunately it caused havoc and there was more damage done so so anyway that's what I think could happen with this if you're not very very careful and if you have a problem with it always you know as somebody in your office ask your manager to help you with it and what they think you can do if your customers understand it and you explain it to them what you you know easily explaining what the obligation is 1 anything of substance must be disclosed and what it by substance I mean mechanical structural anything you know you know there's water in the basement you must disclose that What you can't disclose is anything that would that would cause the buyer or the seller to for instance 'cause the seller maybe not to get the best price because they're highly motivated to sell the house so the the buyer the seller is getting a divorce the seller is transferred and the company isn't helping them at all Anything like that that would cause the seller to not get the top the very best price or perhaps by telling the buyer they may make a lower offer and vice versa but anything of substance roof leaks then you know that must be disclosed right How did this come about it came about because many many many years ago a congressman's daughter was getting married and she and her husband were buying a house and they had a dear friend that was their realtor and they said we really want this house so we're going to i'm just picking a number we're going to offer 500,000 but if we have to we'll pay 550 So that agent went to the cellar years ago we could go right to the seller and present our offers he went to the seller and he said my customers are offering 500 but they really want the house and if they have to they'll go to 550 of course the seller said OK I'll take 550 They got the house and they paid 550 at some point in time not too long after there was a neighborhood party and the previous seller came to it and told them what had happened The congressman was infuriated by that because he felt the listing agent should have kept that confidential which he should have I mean the buyer's agent should have he should have kept that confidential And so they made this law buyer's agent seller's agent what what are the obligations and making it very clear did you have a question no it's OK So that's how that all came about and that that part was good you know if that happens as a listing agent do I need to tell the still tell the the seller I'm sorry so the if the leasing agent knew that information from the buyer's agent does the listing agent should tell the the seller that buyer's agent they are willing to pay more Of course he did yeah I mean that's I mean for it yes yeah they of course he told the seller that you know that this that's what the listing agent And that day the listing agent wasn't there because years ago you could just go right to the seller and present your offer you didn't go through the listing agent now you go through the listing agent you don't even see the seller but yeah of course he he did and he told the seller that and that was a big mistake on his part his response to it was look I didn't want to waste time I knew other offers were coming in and I wanted them to get the house It wasn't a good idea it wasn't good logic but anyway OK I have one question as a buyer this agents is it OK to contact listing agent and and ask for it do you have any other offer like yeah and they'll well they tell you no OK most of them won't tell you OK by the it's OK to ask OK So usually what I do when I have an offer or what I did do when I have an offer is I would call the listing agent I would say I have somebody interested I was just wondering if you could tell me if you have any other offers right and then I might and I might say you know could you tell me what it is they'll always say no and they should always say no because of confidentiality I'm going to i'm going to switch into something quick in a minute just because confidentiality came up and and but I can say to them well can you tell me are any of them over a full price and they may say yes yeah is it close to full price they may say yes or no you know you can try to wiggle it out thank you thank you but now if you're a listing agent and this will happen to you and you're about to close on a property and maybe an appraiser calls you and and asks you you know you you can as long as you feel it's going to close pretty soon sometimes you do help the appraisers out and give them a close number you know so a little bit more defined number confidentiality is one of the things we owe our customers you know and as a listing agent if I have five offers I am not supposed to tell anybody what those offers are ever right because those offers came to you in the form of comfort those all those offers are confidential So I'm going to jump out of this for a minute and get into what you will learn is an escalation clause in a contract OK many times you will see on the listing no escalation clause anybody have any clue what an escalation clause is Trying to find my brain it's OK counter offers no I need to make it like faster so in escalation clause is when somebody 

Amount so I will pay more now how does it work it means that then the listing agent has to show the buyer that contract so the whole contract so where they may redact the name but where is the confidentiality then so it's it's going to become a court case pretty soon I'm sure it is once once they get rid of all the other things this is going to be a problem because buyer may not proceed with that if if if the offer now if he said $20,000 higher than any offer it just it just does pay $20,000 more than any other offer but sometimes they say I will pay 20 up to $20,000 higher than any offer not anymore sometimes they say up to $5000 higher than any offer with a limit sometimes they put a limit on it to a certain amount OK so so the confidentiality is reached to some extent So how is it legal it is now it is legal it's still it's still floating out there and it works sometimes sometimes it works as a buyer's agent and especially in this crazy market it worked you know but I do feel that somewhere along the line some lawyer is going to catch it and decide that it isn't legal because of our obligation of confidentiality so anyway no have I ever done a escalation clause II steer away from it so when somebody wants to do that I steer away from it mostly because it's not accepted by most listing agents they hate it is it usually the buyer that comes up with that or will the buyer's agent like come up with that idea to tell the buyer it's it's usually the buyer because most agents I mean the agents can come up with it too you know that this is a way so when somebody loses 7 houses sometimes you know everybody decides to try it Can it work yeah it works Does the listing agent hate it yeah because now she or he has much more work to do you know they have to be in that position where they're breaching confidentiality they show it to the other person and especially if there's a cap on it if there's a cap on it then you know it may be for not maybe you know the person might say no never mind I'm not doing it right but you're basically showing that buyer the other people's offer and yet a minute ago we just said if we call them they can't tell you so this is a very Gray area so just be careful of it And in your zip forms I do believe there is a document for an escalation clause that you can use it's very easy you know so just be aware of what it is but look at your look at your listing and in remarks there may be a statement saying no escalation was on the listing itself on the face of the listing that in the remarks or in the broker remarks it might say no escalation clause they they they don't necessarily believe in it at one point the MLS forbad it but they came back and you know now they are accepting it and anyway so here you have the agency agreement please read this over so you fully understand what your obligation is as a buyer's agent as your duties as a buyer's agent and your duties as a dual agent make sure you fully understand that OK now let's get to this notice leave this notice before signing the contract This this first line is really important and most most brokers don't read it the law requires that real estate brokers give you the following information before you sign the contract it requires us to tell you that must read it read all of it before you sign the purpose is to help you help help you in the purchase of this home and this is where you have to say what you're going to be so if I'm selling a listing from the Edgewater office I'm going to be a disclosed dual agent right And which means I am representing basically both the the the seller and the buyer You will not get any legal advice unless you have your own lawyer I can't give legal advice you can't give legal advice the only legal advice you give is to tell them to hire a lawyer you know so in your when you are working with a customer a buyer or a seller say you know before we even start this process is a good idea to you for you to research who you would like to hire as your lawyer it's always good to have a lawyer online you know and two questions I always ask the lawyer are you a real estate attorney OK are you going to be available to to look at this contract in an expedited way in other words don't take this deal and go to Italy for a month Don't take this deal and go to your kids graduation for a week you know you want lawyers that are ready willing and able to work and perhaps maybe not a sole practitioner So make make sure that's a good thing This is an important line if you do not hire a lawyer no one will represent you in legal matters now or at the closing neither I nor the company will represent you in these matters The contract is the most important part of the transaction it determines your rights your risks and obligations signing the contract is a big step a lawyer will review the contract and help you understand it and to negotiate its terms The contract becomes final and binding unless your lawyer cancels it within the following three business days that's why it's important to make sure they're there that they're they're going to be doing it if you do not have a lawyer you cannot If you do not have a lawyer you cannot change or cancel the contract unless the other party agrees neither can the real estate broker nor the title insurance company change this contract they must get a lawyer for the 3 day attorney review and by the way this is nowhere else Just this northern part of New Jersey has the attorney review way southern Jersey doesn't even have it New York doesn't have it totally different process right so so people coming here from out of the area won't know about this until you advise them about the attorney review. The contract becomes final and binding unless your lawyer cancels it within the following three business days paragraph five another important service of a lawyer is to order the survey the title report or other important reports the lawyer will review them and help you resolve any questions that may arise about the ownership condition of the property these reports and surveys can cost you a lot of money a lawyer will also prepare the documents needed to close title and prepare you for the closing So paragraph six just tells you a buyer without a lawyer is really basically stupid you know a buyer without a lawyer runs special risks only a lawyer can advise the buyer about what to do if problems arise concerning the purchase of the problem property the problems may be about the seller's title the size and shape of the property or other matters that may affect the value of the property if either the broker or the title company knows about problems they should tell you but they may not recognize the problem from your point of view or know what to do ordinarily the broker and the title company have an interest in seeing that the sale is completed because only then do they usually receive their commissions so their interest may differ from yours whether you retain a lawyer is up to you it's your decision the purpose of this notice is to make sure you have the information needed to make a decision it is extremely important because now you go to the first page of the contract and it says this is a legally binding contract that will become final within three days during this. You may choose to consult an attorney who can review and cancel the contract C section on attorney review for details so in other words this document is saying you can't cancel it without an attorney after it's legally binding after it's been signed by both parties you know if you don't have an attorney So that doesn't mean that somebody makes an offer and then the next day they change their mind they can't just withdraw it but if it's under you know if it's in if they don't have an attorney it's basically binding after the 3 day. Right so and so don't be shocked I remember the 1st when this 1st came out this wasn't in effect when I started in real estate when it 1st came out the 1st letter I got from an attorney And in those days they had to send a registered letter came and it said this contract is voided Oh my gosh you know I just wrote the contract and now it's voided so that's what they used to do now you'll get a letter saying that this contract is avoided unless these paragraphs are approved by the buyer and the seller so they put different they change a lot of the paragraphs nothing substantial just sometimes it is versus a as or whatever just Yeah is it a user of practice that they'll make the new contract yeah yeah and it's all boilerplate and very rarely do they stick with this but it is important because this is the guideline that they have to use all right so so right here parties and description buyers which will auto fill from that other page agrees to purchase from the sellers which will auto fill from that other page Sometimes it doesn't because if you look at your listings if you go into the MLS and look at a listing it's very rare that the listing broker puts the sellers name I don't know why because all you have to do is go up to that other bar you know that other taxes and it will come up so you may have to do that you may have to go up and find the sellers name on the tax records and put that in there OK and whose address is whose address is could be different from the property right so they could be living in California and selling a property in New Jersey so then then you would put their actual address and then then the following line says the broker name in this contract at the price in terms stated below the following the following is through the brokers thing in this contract at the price return state of the law the following property and that's the property that you're selling and that should auto default default again check it So here's where we get into a little craziness because they never changed this contract so on line 43 that would be your purchase price so if the house is selling for 1,000,000 and your your customers are offering 1,000,025 and we put that there you know whatever it is their offers keep in mind we will go through the million the change in the millionaires tax there's been a change so a buyer up until a couple of months back was obliged to pay 1% of the millionaire's tax on any home over a million right That was changed by laws saying that the sellers obligation is to pay it and now it's on a scale so under I have to get that scale out it can go up to almost 3% depending on the value of the property Just so you know on line 45 it has initial deposit and why that's there is that years ago the person would sign the contract give us a check for maybe $1000 right the law said that that should be deposited right away because it was nothing but a piece of paper unless it was valid so you have to get it deposited into the Realtors escrow account and then you present the contract and then the law said wait a minute you can't hold on to that contract for less than 20 that document that check for less than 24 hours so quickly you had to get it in they they then you're renegotiating the contract You have to drop another contract you have to return that check pull it out of escrow get another check so we decided not us but everybody decided we're not taking that $1000 doesn't mean anything anyway so we go right down to line 46 so in your mind whenever you're drawing up a contract eliminate initial deposit So when anybody was drawing their contract when they were writing it did you put anything in there an initial deposit I thought the down payment but that's not correct yeah the down payment would go well actually it the down payment doesn't even go there it can go there and I'll tell you when it should go there but the additional deposit is usually but 10% traditionally people put 10% down as an initial deposit but let's say you're doing an FHA or VA it could be a lot less it could be anything you know and if you want to make a very very strong contract you could put the whole deposit down there keeping in mind that that has to be turned over to the attorney usually within 10 days review so they need to have it I also to make a perfect contract will put in additional contractual provisions that will get to that the that you have a proof of funds for that amount of money and and a proof of funds for the total amount down right not everybody does that but it will make yours look strong when you do that so I'm buying a house I'm going to put 20% down normally nobody has a proof of funds for that for some reason I don't know why but if you go ahead and say look I have the proof of funds for that to go along with the contract plus your your mortgage approval that makes a really really strong contract right OK so but initial deposit is is blank additional deposit would be just the 10% or 5% or whatever they're putting down that's the same as the down payment for mortgage right it is oh the initial well the the additional deposit it could be just 10% and if they're putting down 20% then the balance of the purchase price would be another 10% on this bottom line Got it if it is an epitade then they should put the 3% there too yeah yeah yeah And the text sign to the the owner of the house or the tech who's who's the payable to the text when you write the initial deposit the additional deposit right the payable 2 is the name of usually to the attorney OK and sometimes you don't know that who that is so so you you know you have to find out who that's going to be and the escrow account will be controlled by attorney we don't have an escrow account anymore Realtors usually stay away from it so it would go into the attorneys escrow account thank you OK I guess if you wanted to what you would have to do is you would have to call the listing brokers i'm looking to present an offer to you I need to know your the attorney for your your seller if they don't have an attorney yet the check could be made out to I guess the seller that can then endorse it to the attorney or it could make be made out Umm try to think of who else it could be made out to it's usually best to be held in the escrow account of the is it orchestrated by the attorney of the buyers attorney too or what do you mean like like sending additional deposit like don't the lawyers talk to each other and the lawyers talk to each other but this is your this is the lawyers guideline as opposed to abide by this particular guideline you know so if we say that let's say it's an FHA and it goes under additional deposits only 3% you just put the 3% down there OK or you could put one percent and 2% at closing however you want to do it but I would always ask the people to make sure they send us proof of funds that that money's in their bank account right OK so so you have your additional deposit is your first deposit really and the mortgage amount is the amount that the mortgage broker has said that they qualify for and then the balance of the purchase price is the balance of the additional deposit and so you have the initial additional deposit the balance of the difference between the the the mortgage and the what's left over that they have to bring to the closing so let's say it's a 20% down loan and so they put 10% down as initial as additional deposit then the 80% mortgage amount and then another 10% goes under balance of purchase prices 48 You might want to all write that in so you just use I use 10% because usually that is traditionally what most brokers expect people to put down unless it's in FHA or VA loan So 46 and 48 are the same amount so they can be yeah if it's a 20% down loan they would be if it's 30% down it would be different it would be 10% on the additional deposit and then 20% balance and then they're getting a 70% mortgage right And remember everybody has to initial all this so when this goes through zip forms by the way it's very easy for the seller to sign because it won't move forward unless they initial and do what they have to do right And on line 51 manner of payment we're not using that line at all you on zip forms you can strike it out or could just leave it blank but on line 56 is where the additional department deposit is now and is now put in so additional deposit to be paid by the fire to the parties we will be responsible for holding the escrow who is identified below honor before if left blank then within 10 business days after the fully signed contract has been delivered to both by himself so the additional deposit is usually given within 10 days of attorney review over and the and that gives you usually the time to find out who the attorney's going to be for sure you know that and given to the sellers attorney with intent business days if you leave it blank in this very competitive market where you want your offer to be perfect I tighten that time up I put that it will be available within one day or one day after attorney review so you can make that date whatever your date is right And that would go under the initial deposit and it would tell in the interest bearing and non interest bearing account of the seller's attorney by that time because you've gone through attorney review you will know who the attorney is right so you would put it into the account of you know whoever the attorney is can I ask why it makes it stronger like by having it one day available after it because they don't have to wait to see when the 10% is coming in and make sure it's really coming in yeah so if you tighten your contract so that it's expedited basically it looks stronger and line 6060 or 50 if performance by the buyer is contingent upon obtaining a mortgage and it goes through the entire thing basically a mortgage loan by the seller or other than assuming a mortgage this believe it or not there are a few mortgages that out there that are assumable The problem is they're so low that it doesn't pay to bother because your next your in order to meet the amount that you need to borrow the other mortgage would be a 2nd mortgage and then that would be a higher rate so it doesn't matter anymore but we have come across a few situations where there was a VA loan out there that is assumable way back when you know from way back when but there are no assumable mortgages right now that are of any substance you know forgive me my eyes are running so bad I'm having time reading this There we go umm if payment of the purchase requires a mortgage loan other than by the seller oh what would that be Could the seller hold the mortgage for the buyer It's called to purchase money mortgage and they could hold it and sometimes it benefits the seller why would it benefit the seller'cause they don't have to pay the they don't have to pay taxes on the money 'cause they're not getting it all at once yeah it would help them with their capital gains and they would get interest So sometimes it's a great thing you you won't if the seller needs that money to go buy something else then it doesn't doesn't help them too much you know if they need the whole amount but anyway So the buyer shall apply for the loan through the lending institution of the buyers choice in writing on lenders standard form within 10 calendar days after the attorney review. Is over again I tighten that up that they will apply immediately for the mortgage OK and where I write that is all of these notes here I go to line 721 paragraph 43 It's additional contractual provision And when I write in this paragraph I write in caps I write you know wire will deploy those deposit 10% immediately after Tennessee review fire will you know apply will deposit 10% immediately after attorney review is completed now this is all depending on whether you're buyer will agree to it Buyer proof of funds for deposit is attached Every good thing about your contract goes in here buyer is limiting the home inspection to mechanical I'll go over this in thorough I'm just giving you a hint as where these things go mechanical structural and environmental so that means there's a slight crack in the woodwork the buyer can't say oh I want that fixed you know that it's just the most important thing Buyer will make up any appraisal gap up to a certain amount you know proof of funds proof of you know funds for that attached you know So all of those good things that you're doing here go here in bold letters buyer does not have another home to sell right sometimes people have a home to sell in order to buy it buy this offer is not contingent on buyer selling any other property In on the in your book there's a thing how to draw a perfect contract it's kind of like a list that you can pick and choose from and those are the things you recommend to your buyers to put in you know they they will not There are many times when buyers eliminate the appraisals It is not contingent upon the appraisal The appraisal is always done if there's a mortgage and sometimes even if it's an old cash deal the attorney may say look you know maybe you should get em phrases and they get an independent appraiser to come in so but be very very careful I do not say to my buyers I am not I do not say I recommend you eliminate your appraisal contingency I say this is how things are being done right now these are some of the things that help people get their offer through if you can afford it if you can do it it's something you might want to consider but it is not something you want to do if you don't have liquid assets to cover any gap in that appraisal right so be careful what you you're saying you're just saying this is what goes on some people eliminate the inspection entirely What they can do with the inspection is as a is maybe say the buyer will agree to pay any inspection defaults or any defaults in the inspection up to $5000 up to $10,000 that's you know something like that which leaves if there's a $20,000 roof to be repaired they only have they're only agreeing to pay 10,000 you know so you you can you can basically limits some of the obligation that they have but yet make it look more appealing to the seller OK but that's where all of this goes this is additional contractual provisions it allows you to personalize this document right OK let's get back here any questions Is this going OK you're getting it got it OK what did you get so far Take your time because this is important I want you to no wait when you keep telling us what to do what to feel sometimes I OK so so many there's so many lines yeah yeah so let's go let's start again then I guess there's a big practice and you know and of course you're not I don't think we're going to do it on on our own for the first couple of times you might yeah you might you might but there's always hope there's always hope yes I mean you I don't think I gave everybody that so in your book supposedly is everybody's telephone number I'll give you out my card you can always I get calls morning noon and night and I don't resent it I love it I want you to be successful I want to help you with your contracts so your first the 1st 3rd person you are supposed to call by the way is your manager because they need to know what you're doing they're responsible for you But if you can't get them call me I'll be happy to help you know so II still I have to call Cynthia I don't know what happened to her deal did she get it or so I talked to her all day Sunday yeah and I'm thrilled I hope she I hope she got it you know and I'm going to bring that one up because that was a really difficult transit if this is the one it was a difficult transaction she had an FHA by right and the seller didn't want an FHA deal why does he tell him not want an FHADU because the FH they feel there's going to be more requests from government and what is what has to be fixed in the house right like the VHO they've gotten much more relaxed but still sellers have prejudice against them so so we need to trade change it into a conventional transaction in changing it to a conventional transaction there was a problem with the the the down payment right and so what what I suggest that she do is raise the price so it was a $300,000 home we raise it up to the cost of the not the home inspection you can't put credits for the home inspection in transaction the mortgage broker won't let you bank won't let you but what you can do is raise the price and then put a that the seller will pay the closing cost thereby allowing them to put more down take the money that they were going to use for closing costs and put it down to make it a full 10% right and so I hope that's the one that went through anybody you're all looking at me like deer in light you know and I like no OK so banks will not allow you years ago you can you could buy a property and say the bank you know OK I want I'll pay this much and I want the seller to pay for repairs up to a certain amount No go anymore but the bank will allow you the seller to pay for the club get a credit to the buyer for the closing bus a seller's concession but only for closing costs right and so you so the seller has agreed to a price it won't come down right but if you raise it for the closing costs say another $10,000 so the buyers pay now paying $10,000 more for the half But the seller is paying his closing costs which allows the buyer to put that money for closing costs down so it usually doesn't cost him anymore in a monthly payment I did that in a house I bought yeah so you'll get it But is there a cap on the number yeah 'cause I did I was buying a house for 250 and I asked for $10,000 setup concession and the buyer wanted 250 they got 250 and they gave me a check they gave the buyer a check for 260 and he gave me a check for 10,000 at the closing OK that's where we belong yeah yeah and you could have used it for your closing question now they're really questions about you using it for your closing quest you know so anyway umm I don't you know if we were downstairs I have a blackboard I don't have one here to show you but it it is basically just money is fungible the word fungible you can move it around you know and so the seller basically doesn't get any more because he's creating it back to the buyer right now being the way the market is and the houses are going so overpriced will they be are there any room to add that being that it's probably overvalued at the purchase price already for appraisal I think that when the appraiser sees that they're giving back the closing costs it's you know the question is what are they really selling it for you know the the appraisers have been in the beginning with all this over pricing we had a lot of problems with appraisal gaps yes we did we're not having them anymore very few yeah very few Does the does the seller pay taxes on that since he got more money no because you'll see when they do the closing and they see their net they wouldn't be doing it'll be a cost of the sale I guess a lot of Southerners don't for some reason I don't like that sometimes I I've heard it makes the deal weaker like the IT can it can but in this case it worked out hopefully it worked that one worked out fine yeah I can but it takes it takes number one the cooperation between the listing agent and and you as a buyer's agent and the listing agent giving them the don't think you don't know this and you're the only one that doesn't know this many listing agents don't even think of it they're not they're not trained they don't understand them of it or the math of it you know and it's not unusual so you have to almost educate your listing agent yeah and yeah it doesn't it doesn't usually run into a problem the problem with this particular transaction was beautiful if if this is what worked out for them it was beautiful because the seller was so afraid of an FHA loan but the buyer only had his 3% and his closing costs So this way we cover the closing cost he could put the difference down and it went with a traditional yeah because II just went two years of looking almost three years of looking for a home and every agent I worked with even mentioning that that we do a center concession they they freaked out like you can't do that I think they didn't understand that you were willing to put the concession above the asking price if if if it in this market if the house was listed for 100 Let's use the number crazy number 100,000 right that's the starting part in this market so houses were going for A150 say or 125 but if you were looking to put a seller's concession on the asking price I agree that nobody would do it it was a crazy market but if you and and I would exploit you'd have to explain it to them that this you are willing to pay more for the concession.

At them and he gave me 4 and they were some of them had been looking a year ago some of them two years ago some of them 3 years ago like you yeah people look for a long time I had no training I didn't know what I was doing But I made a point and I got lucky because the timing was everything those people weren't ready those ages were good ages they just weren't ready and as I told you the downfall of agents they didn't follow through with them Follow through is your friend but it's also your enemy because most agents there's always somebody who slips through the crack and you don't get the follow through so you don't they don't follow through with them I called them they were delighted that somebody even cared about them and wanted to work with them and I saw them and it was just time Yeah so that's how I got the leads they just out of the basket life was much easier than a contract was this was the contract one page and now it's like so much that's more pages yeah but you know on the other hand you have it easier with technology you don't have to keep a book that takes hours every day to fill in all the listings that came you you have the the CRM which will help you you know be able to follow through with those customers you know no I had no hope I just went out and showed houses I even as I told you climb through a window to show a house so I was determined to be successful And it was in New York right I was in New York NJ oh New Jersey OK yeah New Jersey I grew up in Manhattan but my I started my real estate career in New Jersey I did have a New York license which II used to use but II stopped it because I you know I didn't need to use it anymore OK let's get back to this baby OK this on 52 you were recently 52 is the line that you just disregard because that's the initial deposit so cross it out and and by the way on zip forms you can cross it out there's a little cross outs I wouldn't bother with it it's a pain in the neck to do and we're crossing out 51 right now 54 thank you Scratching out is my favorite Scratching out is my favorite We'll have to learn how it they have they have these lines on you know that you can pull over and just cross out like crazy so be careful I did one and initially what I was doing it and for some reason it came out red So I had these red lines going across mine and I couldn't figure out how to get rid of the red lines and I never did nobody knew but hopefully yours doesn't turn red anyway OK so now escrow OK that goes into lawyers where will be performance by contingent upon obtaining a mortgage so basically on line 66 paragraph D most of your your deals will be a mortgage and




----------------------------------------

That on Leonard standard form within 10 days this is the one I already said that you know again going back to that additional contractual provision Spire will apply for a mortgage immediately after attorney review and that goes through that whole thing OK and on lane 75 principal amount again here you're putting in the purchase price and if your zip forms works correctly it might auto fill but not might not and by the way everything you put on here will go back to that first page with the green thing I told you about and then you type the type of mortgage FHAVA section 2O3K conventional and other so 2O 3K do you know what that is OK it's you do right yeah is that two 3 that's where to fix the home yeah it's AI call it a buy it fix it mortgage it's pretty cool so a lot of people buy it So what happens it's complicated and you know a lot of builders don't like it how it works is the bank will lend you the money to acquire the property and to fix it up the problem, The structural additions or anything they have to come inspect it in order to release the rest of the money but it's not only them not only the bank that has to come in then the town has to so that all has to be coordinated so the the building inspector from the town has to come and the bank and the plumbing inspector and the bank and everybody has to so so sometimes there's an old expression is that time is money you know especially when you're flipping houses and using a 203K you lose time yeah II rehabbed one of you know two family and what should have taken maybe in my mind in my mind because I didn't do anything I mean I did takedown one wall but I didn't do anything major structurally you know I just redid the kitchen it did the bathrooms it did the floors painting changed the windows to me it's a 3 month job it took seven months Specter couldn't come this week inspector was sick that week you know I didn't use it yeah and I didn't even use the 2O3K Cabinets were late you know anyway so and I'm sure that the builder I used to have another shop going at the same time you know so so it is time is money so the 2O3K does add time to it but in some cases it's a valuable thing for somebody who doesn't have additional funds to do all that work themselves so in that case I like it if you don't have a lot of if you have time and so you explain what kind of do it what kind and the term of the mortgage what does that mean Yeah how long you want the mortgage for and by the way once this is all over the 203 turns into a usually a 30 year conventional OK that converts So let's say it's a 30 year mortgage and their monthly payments based on What 30 year payments based on 30 years right but can it be a there are many mortgages right now I wouldn't use one but there are you know adjustable rate mortgages so it could be a 30 year mortgage you know based on a it could be adjustable mortgage and say maybe a seven year mortgage with monthly payments based on a 30 year payment you know so it could be anything you could depending on you have to find out what kind of mortgage obviously your person is getting so and then this line 78 this is when the mortgage is done when that you get a letter from the bank saying your mortgage is approved and funded right so I would say that it usually takes 30 days because what has to happen you know all the paperwork has to go to the bank all your paperwork all your customers tax returns everything and then they obviously do a credit thing and then they have to send out an appraiser who you will meet at the house and give him comps when the appraiser comes don't be that realtor that just doesn't show up you got to meet them at the house you got to give them comps especially if it's a multiple offer situation and it goes way over you explain look this this house said 17 offers on it and went way over and but here's another house the same thing happened and here's the price years ago they would never ever ever accept something that is say under contract that you knew went way over but you can say oh you can talk to that broker and say look I have a deal it's you know the appraisers coming out II know for a fact that yours went way over would you mind speaking to my appraiser and they will they usually do and the appraiser will call them and say you know how much over and usually they tell them so it helps some appraisers will do it not all right but the other thing you have to be very careful with and advise your your your customers not to deal with some banks like Rocket Mortgage don't do it and they are appraisers come from everywhere in anywhere and they do not know the nuances of the area So I'll take Ridgewood because for an example if you have a Cape Cod in the lawn section of Ridgewood and you have pretty much the same structure in the height section of Ridgewood prices are going to be totally different completely different way different if your house on the other in Ridgewood on the other side of 17 way different because everybody wants to be close to the town and not have to go over 17 to get to the town or to get to schools so so appraisers have to know that they have to be aware of it and not necessarily are there I recommend I I'm having Unity Bank we we are we do have a relationship with them I would never use anybody other than them do you always have the choice but I always recommend them because they can and they are aware of the good appraisers and they'll make sure the appraisers the right appraiser and that's not to say that it isn't honest it's totally honest they do a great job doing their appraisals do they always appraise no they don't no but but at least we know that that appraiser knows nuances and isn't from South Jersey and I talked to the Unity Bank mortgage and they were only doing qualifying mortgage right so they're not doing non qualifying mortgages like someone who doesn't have a job and buy a dev cash in the account I don't II couldn't get the mortgage from Unity Bank actually yeah yeah they they're not doing anything the worst person isn't qualified but they what they will do is let's say it's somebody who owns a business and they they don't show all their income they can put it into their portfolio loan so they in that in that respect they do yeah but they do qualify them you know can't well they do you know if they have assets and cross cross assets they they'll do that too I'll have them come here and you can ask them any questions you want but that's how we got into a lot of trouble in in you know way back when when we were doing no qualification mortgages you know it's it's but if you can find somebody that does it for your customer by all means I don't I don't even know one that does that you know and so but but they will take they will do for what they call portfolio loans so most mortgage brokers just collect and they give it out to different areas to different banks unity Bank is a bank so they will fund it and if it's somebody that is self employed owns a supermarket or restaurant and they don't show all their income but they fit other standards you know and they see that they have assets they will put them into their portfolio which means the bank doesn't sell that to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac every other loan has is sold to Fred Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac they have to meet very strict guidelines but and qualifications but their portfolio alone is just something the bank keeps themselves..

fanie mae , freddy mae research more. banks sell mortgage to them. but not portfolio loans???



You know like you were talking about where this buyer on a multi 1,000,000 dollar house in Mahwah was turned down by his bank it was strung along for a long time and then turned down and we brought that in that's when I got to meet him and he put him into our portfolio loan and he gave him the mortgage in 2 weeks so save that whole deal that whole transaction which was one of those transactions which was what we call a domino so the seller we had the listing and he was buying another house and we had the sale on his house and we had the buyer it was like four transactions that would have died if this guy didn't buy that house so he's he's with the Unity Bank so who's he with unity unity Bank yeah he'll be here I'm just confirming up when he's going to be here and they'll go over all the different mortgages out the closing works you know the closing statements so you can see them understand what they are you know by the way if somebody says to you could you read this closing statement and explain it to me say that's a question for your attorney yeah don't even try to but but you should be aware of it you should know how it looks 'cause there's so many adjustments back and forth you know OK So keep in mind I wanna I wanna point this out about the closing date and the mortgage commitment date the mortgage commitment date everyone of these dates when the 10% do can I bring my phone up here maybe I didn't oh thanks every one of those dates should be in your phone it's they should be in your CRM too you know but but this is your best friend OK because don't rely on anybody else to keep the timeline but rely on the listing agent don't rely on the attorney II have seen a deal from a brand new agent was one of her 1st deals and what happened was she reminded her buyers to bring the 10% in and the wife said Oh my husband's going to do it tomorrow 10% to bring to deposit the 10% right so she reminded her buyer to have the 10% delivered to the attorney for the purchase of the home the wife said yes my husband's dropping it by tomorrow right She never checked again The attorney knows the money's supposed to be in both attorneys should have checked we get to the closing 10% was never delivered so he had to run out quick grab the money get it you know it was it was really embarrassing so when the 10% is due it's not good enough to say there's always two to three checkpoints not good enough to say hey I'm reminding you your 10% is due Your next step would be what follow up and call the lawyer and say just want to make sure you receive the 10% right that's all you have to do but if you know that it's due on November 1st put it in here put a ring a little bell have it ring and remind you right but don't let let it just go like that the same thing goes for the mortgage date or or during the mortgage you notice now you're two weeks into the mortgage and you have never heard from the appraiser.

time frame check up for agent. did additional amount really came to attorney's account, doble check. 
what more date and time, agent should follow and keep in mind during the process. 


-----------------------------------------------------

Fitting side and and you haven't heard that the appraiser is going out you should call the selling broker and say hey we haven't heard from the appraiser what's going on have you and that and as a seller as the buyer's broker you should be calling the bank and saying where's the appraiser we never heard from him or her or whatever right you got to be on top of that so make sure that's done make sure you are calling the broker all the time the mortgage broker saying how are we doing where are we at is it at underwriting so it goes from the mortgage broker reviews it Who refuse it does enter writing have any questions do they have all their papers you know this isn't big this takes seconds quick phone call underwriting have it is there any paperwork missing put that into your your timeline too it's very very important if you want a nice smooth transactioni

Sometimes even the home inspection even when it comes to the home inspection sometimes those lag and especially and when you're you're you're going to be coming into a spring market where you get really where you'll get busier and so the inspectors get busier too right and so therefore one of the things you want to do is to make sure that make friends with home inspectors right make make sure you know them introduce yourself call them up say hey I you find out from your office who they like to use Who's the inspectors two or three inspectors called them up and say I'm new with Christie's who knew the business do you want to introduce myself in case I may need you you know that type thing and by the way you know you can make friends with other mortgage brokers too sometimes they'll pay for your goodies at your open house you know sometimes people will cross market and those are things you might want to do even building inspectors will do that you know home inspectors So that's a helpful thing to do and we'll talk a lot more about business to business relationships which will be vital to you you know when I first started European days Bond Ridgewood was just opening too and I went there to try it out and we started chatting and so she gave me a everybody that I sold that came into the area a free facial that I gave to my customers so she won because she had new customers I won because my customers were thrilled to get the new facial and it was made a nice bond so those are one a few of the things you can do to to create that you can do that with any business you know and make sure like when you're using at turf I'm going off here a bit but when you're using at turf you could go to the local dry cleaners and say you know show them a picture of that turf say I could promote your business if you would want to give me a discount for all of my customers right may I put my cards on your shop You know even the delis even restaurants there's one guy in Mahwah he doesn't work for us he's with another company but he is a master at restaurants giving giving you know a free dessert the lady in the restaurant the lady in the restroom nobody know nobody went in OK well then never mind i'm sorry what happened no nothing I think I think there is a Halloween toy it's like a prop in there 'cause I need to go to the bathroom what is it I should bring I should bring henry and I have a big big my son was taking medical courses and we had to get a real skeleton so he went from that to being our Halloween prop I call him Henry he hangs out with my barn so anyway I'm getting back to this now I lost my train of thought what was I going on about Oh call me inspectors relationship yeah and and so make sure you you know you make friends with all these people they'll want to work with you lawyers you know they'll want to work with you they're looking for business And that reminds me too i'm going to jump back to that because you'll be presenting this you'll be sending when when your customer signs this and you get it fully executed and you tell they tell you who the lawyer is say would you like me to develop you know to give this to your lawyer so when you give it to the lawyer you give them this with a copy of the survey if you have it with everything together in the same package but an additional picture the MLS listing so they can see all that but then make sure you you call the lawyer introduce yourself and say you know I'm working for with your client Mr and Missus Smith is there anything else you may need I'll be happy to do that you know if it's a condo they may ask you to find the rules and regulations and get it for them and they may ask you to do a number of things but you want to make friends with that attorney and with their paralegal probably more importantly so when you now we haven't been going to Closings because of Covid but now we're back to going to them and when you go bring a little something to the paralegal or to the attorney and or the secretary or their admin or whatever they want to be called because guess what someday a couple is going to come in getting a divorce and they're going to ask the attorney you know what should we do about the house and he may ask the admin and the admin to say 0 I know this great realtor That happens a lot right yeah so we're in a state situation where they don't know who to market the house with and you're friendly with the admin and she'll say why don't we use you know this person or that person right so always think of business and helping people you know So




------------------------------------------


When it's getting closer and closer we're calling the mortgage broker on a weekly basis and say hey where is it how we doing are we going to be on time what if we're not on time This is Doc is a sequential document with a timeline everything has to be met within the time frame right so let's say the mortgage broker says you know we're having a little issue We have to clarify something for your buyer We are not going to make that dead deadline we we need another week What do you think your job is to do right then and there amendment amendment of the contract call the lawyer and say look we're not going to make that date We need to send out a letter to the buyers attorney the seller's attorney and extend the mortgage commitment date because if you don't guess what this deal is dead in the water they violate it that timeline now does everybody take it that strictly no but is it true yes it's dead in the water and if there's a backup offer there's that window of opportunity for that backup offer that's higher and the seller wishes they were able to take it to move right in And what happened with the deposit that they buy it already made If they don't get the mortgage it's returned to them as long as they acted in good faith if they can prove that they did something to sabotage the mortgage and which would be really hard to prove but if they did do something to sabotage it they they that might be in question that might be in course Nobody usually takes it to court because by the time you pay the lawyers not worth it OK So so here's where this is where your most important job is to follow through follow through follow through follow through if you want a good transaction and if you keep it in here it frees your brain and then it's a two minute phone call right because once this date is is bypassed it's gone by the seller even if they don't have a backup offer is in a panic situation because most likely they bought another home or they're depending on that closing so they're in a panic situation they're stressed beyond belief and now they're thinking the deal is going to die So number one you have the lawyer send the request for an extension calms things down a little bit and you talk to the listing agent and say look there was just a little hitch in the no no problem you can talk to the mortgage broker just a few pieces of paper that were missing or lost were somewhere and we just need them and we'll be fine All right hopefully that's the truth you know OK balance of purchase price is shall not be paid by shall be paid by the buyer in cash or certified cashier's check our trust account check and that is on the day of closing so the balance of the purchase price comes in the day of closing let's say the the seller has some liens against the house this contract provides for them to be able to pay those liens From the proceeds at the closing OK you all look like you need a break i'm giving you a quick break and then we'LLS

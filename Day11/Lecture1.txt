The Start Now button so once you're ready to hit start now it will then start with your business name now for all intensive purposes consider that this is a one time shot you can change everything but it gets real persnickety when you change your business name So what should your name be you when we talk about this Google business this is 100 percent about you and you alone so your Google business name is generally gonna be you your name followed by your title Now if you're going mark I don't know exactly what that is So that's traditionally something you're gonna give out something you're gonna have on your published materials so when in doubt that should be the name of your business Now you can do realtor you can do license real estate agent you can do a couple variations there is no one silver bullet for all of it but if you're absolutely clueless when in doubt just mirror what's on your business card that is the safest answer so if you don't have any ideas just what look at your business card literally how your name is formatted dash and however your title is formatted More creative if you want but just make sure you please get it right on the first try that's sort of the goal here It will forgive you later but it may ask you to reverify it that's not something you wanna do we'll talk about that later so just note here as well if you put Christie's in your business name I have to have a problem with you so we are the brokerage you are the agents that you don't mix in this specific area so this is representing you not us so please don't include Christy's Christy's international real estate Christy's international real estate group anything that includes our company name I have to come to you and legally have to ask you to change so please don't make me do that Not everyone who fights by that by the way but that is the legal answer so please don't use Christy's in your business name now the next question is business category you must select real estate agents There are no other choices available to you that is what you are and you also start typing it in it will auto complete it click it from the drop down if you type it in it doesn't work you have to start typing it in and then click it from the auto complete list because Google is highly inconsistent and you will hear me say that multiple times so again if you select agency or brokerage that's us and again I have to come to you and ask you to change it Now do you have a physical location yes you are affiliated with an office this is a yes no question say yes It will then ask you what your business address is that is the office that you are affiliated to so if you are hosting a client if you're hosting an attorney if you're doing a closing this will be the physical space that your license resides and where you technically do your business so do not enter your home address Even though this is representative of you I do not want your home address published to everyone on the Internet so please don't do that and if you did do that please change it that is a security risk Now that is exactly why when you get here stop we are not talking about Christies so at the next screen it's going to say 0 we noticed other businesses match this address are you Christy's no you are none of these you will establish your own business representing you personally so it will look something along like this the only corrector and correct answer here is it does not match that if you select something else you will try to claim ownership of our business and again I legally have to come after you notice that's another theme I'm talking about here there's lots of pitfalls which is why I do this class so the second question is do you offer service deliveries for home visits Why yes we travel to people's homes all the time so again easy yes no question say yes to this it's going to ask you what services come a little bit later now when you service an area it will ask you the area that you service so I recommend a minimum of one county and 3CITIES to enter into this field you can always do more this is an easy field any of the optional fields you can always come back and edit later and it won't trigger anything bad down the road So this is something that you can spend more time on later I recommend just as a bare minimum you do a primary town choose secondary towns and a primary county When it gets your contact information cell phone and website URL this is where for the website URL you can go to Christy's real estate group dot com you should open it another tab the Christie's Real Estate

Copy that URL from the Christy's website profile now you can always use your own mark.com would be a fantastic URLI wish I bought it ages ago when the Internet first started that would have been great so if you have your own domain please by all means feel free to use that but if you don't have 1 or you sort of just give me a blank stare about website who has a website please absolutely use hours you can get cross linked you can bridge off of our SCO that we're building by linking our website to your Google business profile especially if you have nothing else to put there that's a free upgrade Now once you've entered all your contact information it's going to trigger the verification process this can happen multiple ways you can do a phone call you can do a text message which is new the old school way was a postcard mailed to the office with a 6 digit code and I swear I just had to do this with of all places the Atlantic Club I had she had to post the construction website for the mailman every day to make sure we got the postcard That's only land allows them to verify that business crazy so that's horrible postcards the worst choice by far that's a secondly followed by the video this is the newest choice that they're doing so you'll see here that there is a phone code a call or text message an email code or a business video Newer accounts if you're new to Google business especially if you just created a brand new account my dear you will probably expect to have to do a business video You know for example here in Mobber and I used to do a little bit of AA shopping complex so in this one it would be very easy to show your neighbors showing the outside signage showing the logo on the wall when you walked in showing your business card that you work here and showing that you have permission to be on site that you are employed by this place so there's a lot of prerequisites you have to do it within 3 minutes but if you are one of the newer locations for example everyone in the Edgewater has to do Google the business video it's a new address but if you're also a new Google account you will have to hit the video choice a lot more frequently Once you enter that verification code it can take a few minutes or two weeks again love the consistency with Google it will tell you anywhere between 1 and 5 business days I have had to take up to 14 so don't be surprised now if you do a text message you will generally instant verify which is what hopefully 80% of you in the room will have happened Now you will finally get this message you are being verified by Google please know that some of the options will be restricted until you have been able to finish that verification process now at some point again this may be slightly out of sequence as you're doing it but at some point in the process you will get a list of services to add now generally speaking do you do everything like do you do appraisals for example no do you do buying agents services yes can you refer out to both of them So even if you have the ability to refer out to someone if it's something that you don't necessarily do like farm sales is one of the choices for example you can still select it and be included in that range of searches to be added to that hemisphere of inclusivity now when you get to business hours do we work 24/7 of course we do so you can just have your Google business reflect that it is the fewer number of clicks You can also put 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM 7:00 to 7 whatever your That's fine I mean look people are gonna call you when they want to call you so you can put whatever you want here I don't know if people really will abide by it so whatever you'd like to put here as your publicly stated business hours really is fine there is no set standard Now this is an old screen I don't think they're doing this anymore but I left this in the presentation anyway because he goes a little random so messaging just means someone can email you so if you get this screen that says allow messaging just leave it on yes that just means that someone would potentially be able to email your business that's all that means Now for your business description we are definitely going to talk about this in the next presentation that's a lot of that presentation actually so we're going to come back to this but for right now just to put something in here and move your process along try just the first paragraph of your bio whatever you have since you're already on the Chrissy's Real Estate group website to grab the URL go ahead and grab the first paragraph of your bio and just put that in here in your business description you can skip it


150 character limit that will be very important later down the road now for now the storefront photo skip this for now we'll come back to this later Any photos photos of your business add a photo any prompt for photos during the wizard simply skip for right now now there are also several other things to skip Towards the end of this you may see a screen that looks like this put your business on the map this is the older version of this screen there are 2 check boxes here this is super deceptive because they say get news and get invitation so if you'd like to get spam go ahead and check those boxes but they have nothing to do with your Google business coming online so those are both two check boxes you can sit if you see those prompts the other one is the $500 advertising credit they will shove it down your throat at every turn So just whenever you see that go ahead and hit skip again if you want to try to upsell on a business package you can try to be put into the Google Workplace business package but ultimately that is something that you can skip Photos skip during setup we're gonna talk about this in just a second but skip anything during the wizard once you've been verified your prompts will become fully visible and now we can go ahead and talk photos so once you've completed the wizard once you see these buttons show up this means you are now in full control of your Google Business now here


Have to land first this is a Google secret you will not see this posted anywhere I had just done thousands of these and I can tell you this is how it works you have to land photo 1 and photo 2 before you do anything else or these photos never set correctly So cover photo is a wide photo that's the first place that you can use the Christie's logo now I do recommend you use the nice rot red wide 1 in the quickest way to get to it charlie did me a favor is to put it on his old dashboard this is version one of the Internet system so it's still on dashboard dot botillo .com so it's at if you Scroll down it's the first red logo on the old website so I do recommend that you download the red fire group Red Square and use that as your cover photo that's gonna pop and that will be the advertisement of who you work for Now logo on the other hand is going to be your face it's going to be locked into a square aspect ratio so you want your face to show layer across the Google ecosystem that your business represents so when it comes to adding a logo that's where you're gonna add your headshot and you're gonna crop it down to a nice square image After that you can go back and add the storefront photo that is what we're gonna talk about again in the next section for AII missing a slide on that I see actually so above your Google Business buttons there will be a little circle with a completion ring at a complete button when you click that link the complete info link you will get back to I need to put this in a different order you will get back to this storefront photo prompt store front photo is gonna be your photo number 3 after you do the two aforementioned ones so I know this seems very strange but I have just done this often enough and you have to get these photos in the right sequence are they never end up in the right sequence after this you can delete them all and start over that's the only other choice so in the next segment we're gonna talk about adding updates to your Google business That's where additional photos will filter in successfully once you do number 12 and three as outlined now the whole point that we're doing this is dishing to getting you published on the event is to get your Google Business reviews so once your business is actually set up and verified it's fully online it's fully public you can now click on the button that says ask for reviews when you click this link you are not gonna ask Google to email your people So if you click email Whatsapp or Facebook it will be Google going out on your behalf not so much not I don't love that situation So what you're gonna do here is you're gonna copy this review link right here Save that link if you're on a Mac like I am I like to recommend that folks use the Notes app generally speaking your Notes will transfer between any devices on your Apple account so I generally like to have that available We're gonna talk again in the next section about a script what to actually say when sending your review link so for the moment the goal is just have this link accessible whatever that means for you so if you need to email This to yourself if you need to save it as a Word document on your desktop whatever you need to do to just save this link you're gonna make this accessible and we're gonna use this again in the next section so you're gonna ultimately invite your client use this link themselves and leave you a positive Google review now you will notice Google businesses with five or more reviews get ranked up so I will go through all this in the next section but again just keep an eye on this think about who are the five people that you could help with hypothetically send a Google review to and get a favorable outcome So we'll talk more about how to in the next section two so congratulations though far I'm doing pretty good i'm coming I rounded up an hour So any questions on doing a Google business and now we're gonna sort of talk the advanced level of how you can leverage this with your AI components OK great now I'm just gonna preemptively gonna stop sharing right now
 OK great now I'm just gonna preemptively gonna stop sharing right now OK great now I'm just gonna preemptively gonna stop sharing right Now

 Seeing my screen please just someone chat me and confirm make sure that you all can see my new presentation here please Wonderful thank you so much much appreciated sorry for the technical difficulties OK so Full disclosure I had half of this written an Inman article came out they gave me the other half and it's a wonderful creative endeavor between the two of us so I like the product of this this is a little high level so I'm glad she's gonna say right now at any point you feel yourself glazing over and tuning out that's OK take a moment you can shut down for that slide try to come back to the next one and I will be publishing these notes This happens to be the first run of this publicly congratulations to you also November is the version 2 of this with its full chat script included so if you registered this morning using the QR code you should have received a reply email with a chat GPT script so we're gonna get into that in just a minute I have copied you all on that and provided a link to it so you can copy and paste it to your own chat GBT session so if you did not do that I will throw up that QR code one more time at the end of class here So just follow along and just note that that is coming when I make reference to it in my presentation here OK now the whole purpose of this is we don't do Yellow Pages anymore so when people are searching for you the old standard and still is used to be well who am I gonna Google well congratulations now it's gonna be they're gonna ask chat GBT but chat GBT sort of changes the rules a little bit someone might Google real estate agent Mahwah but now they're gonna ask chat GPT hey who is the best real estate agent in Mahwah so different type of way of thinking and this is gonna cover how you can magnetize yourself and make yourself attractive to chat GBT to be the agent that AI recommends when clients go searching like that now it is gonna require a little work on your part but I've sort of melded together some previous ideas from previous classes to give you some time saving tricks and to understand that you're doing one thing a week but you're gonna be replicating at multiple places so the action here is going to be a lot of replication once you get into your groove and you get sort of the basic principles understood so as we're aware today it's more of an AI focus on everything you're now gonna use more plain language you're gonna ask questions you're gonna be conversational and again as we can talk about this think about how you have used chat GPT now when you ask chat GPT notice it never ends your your prompt with a period it always ends in with a question so you have to follow the same tricks so when you're doing your social media posts we're gonna talk about making them conversational and ending in questions OK step one and this is why this is the follow up to this is lock in your Google business profile there are multiple models out there gemini is obviously Googles but all models scan Google's business engine so regardless of who you're looking at the Google Business database is one of the primary public databases of information that AI models have available to it to index and look and see what's available to it there so advertising yourself attractively on Google Business is where we start this conversation hopefully you all just did it or have one from the last section so when we talk about this you're gonna replicate everywhere describe this process more but we're starting with Google Business because it's the one that hopefully you have as the Bedrock Foundation So first things first is just make your profiles complete so when you're looking at a profile again I'm gonna talk about Google Business but I mean this about all your profiles your Instagram profile your Facebook profile all profiles so did you complete every field are you giving AI the chance to scan and say 0 mark specializes in real estate technology do you use that phrase across all of the profiles that the AI engines and search engines are looking for So filling everything out in your profiles like we just did for your Google business is going to be more important and that's why I actually highlight the storefront photo we're going to talk about being hyper local so you'll see that uploading real media interior and exterior shots of actual physical locations are going to be things that give you relevance and credence when an AI engine searches for you now posting weekly I understand what ask this is I know most folks are like Mark your brother lucky if I post monthly yes they get it but AI is fallible because humans that built it are fallible AI has several cognitive biases that's a whole topic for a whole other thing but the one I'm gonna talk about is relevancy AI has a relevancy bias so we're gonna talk about that in just a second but posting weekly is a great way to stay ahead of that relevancy bias that it has now the quickest way again we just need Google Business once you lock in your first 3 photos your logo your storefront and your cover photo So everything after that will then start to work successfully so the quickest way on your business is to just click the Add Update button that you have a quick update to tell your business so to speak there are other types of posts like offers for example but an update is gonna be the quickest way to get your information out there now I'm not talking about a lot it's gonna be a photo or video and a brief text description that's it So you're already going to be doing that for Instagram for Facebook for Linkedin so you're just gonna apply this and extend it out to all your profiles and use that same methodology everywhere now you're gonna turn on messaging like we mentioned it's gonna go to your phone or email or like you may use a Google Voice number for your business as well so whatever your primary contact information is establish that and make sure it's set up as your contact information in your Google business now get back to the point of your source of truth and this is an

 Name address phone number it's that same standard rubber stamp information that represents you so for example if you change your phone number 2 years ago on three websites that might be this number and on four websites it might be another number well guess what that's a big no no for chat GPT so when it scans these websites and sees conflicting information you get filtered to the bottom of the pile so standardizing your information uniformly and everywhere is going to be one of the quickest ways to get attracted by your AI scanning engine so you should do that anyway just for Good Housekeeping I would like to call that out but the objective now that you're doing this with a fresh set of eyes is standardizing refining and making yourself attractive to searching and I'll talk more about how to use that specific language as we go here so the idea is as we go standardizing and multi use your profile information and the posts themselves that you spend a lot of time and energy to create Alright so far so good so we talked about Google Business Here is your chat GPT script I promise you a little bonus treat at the end here so this is a script and if


 Your city or real estate area your specific neighborhoods or property types that you specialize in yes chat GPT needs to know what it's talking about So anywhere that you see the brackets in my script replace it with that information about you What neighborhoods do you service what towns do you provide what counties are you located in all that information back still wherever you see the brackets in this Sprint so by the time you're done if you still see a bracket you're not finished That's your goal so give the script this information that describes you in the correct location Now the last bracket here is paste your current bio leave LA while your service area is all your towns all your neighborhoods all your specialties all your awards all that good stuff your existing bio whatever you have hopefully that's published on the Christy's website so publish whatever you have here paste that right here and then feed the whole thing start to finish to chat GPT yeah.


 Even Hope New York so you do wanna be all encompassing but in your instance you do have to flex 'cause you still only have 750 characters so that's where Chat GBT should hopefully be able to help you out go ahead and you can always give Chat GBT too much because you're directed to chat TBT is stay within seven hundred and 750 characters so you can give Chat GPT more than that its job is to meld it down into the format that you're looking for So that's a great example don't be afraid to throw more information at this script and that's why we're involving Chat GPT Brain to get it to fit the box that we need it to So this is your little so please don't do this this second it will take you and please spend quality time on it 'cause this is gonna be your template that is your public facing persona everywhere so it's worth developing this and making sure that you love it so when you're budgeting time marketing feedback social media whatever this should sort of bubble up towards the top in my opinion you wanna start getting that standard set of information including your bio that you can replicate everywhere that we're about to talk about now hopefully this makes it a little easier in my first draft of this bio sorry if anyone's listing from home Dell you guys didn't get this because it wasn't done yet so this is the final version this is the first time you guys are seeing it so anytime that you get new information feel free to go back to that script update it and have chat GBT run it with you maybe you do get licensed in a new state maybe you get a new award or a new designation so keep that script handy and hopefully it's something that can grow with you as well OK now when we talk about reviews the other big thing of the whole reason we went through Google business is so you can get reviews why because that is a huge place that AI is looking AI has a lot of time and power on its hands so if I want to search every review for Mark Sweetheart on the Internet it's gonna go through every single website and try to find how many stars you got how many awards you got how many reviews you got So when you're starting to ask folks for these reviews


 Right a hyper local review about you now the first section here is coaching your clients folks you've directly had a transaction with great they bought they sold whatever start with your easy folks don't give yourself a headache right off the bat maybe you can even start with people who have already written you a review in another way maybe they sent you a great greeting card reach out to them and say hey I'm really trying to build my online profile I just started my Google business Would you be willing to meet a Google review mentioning the neighborhood price point and how I helped you in the transaction to help other neighbors find me now this is a sample obviously take the gist of it write it in your own tone but this is a quick easy way that should hopefully be very disarming to just encourage folks to give you some positive feedback Now it's not just stars yeah I scheduled the


 So again including areas neighborhoods all great things that you can do with a trusted vendor or someone else that you have worked with Yeah hyperlocal contact so AI is more targeting like clients are more targeting now instead of just Mahwah it may be streets or school districts in Mahwah so turning these items into multiple form videos is how I recommend that you accomplish this goal the best so when you're talking about a post think about how you could possibly make it video make it a Youtube short make it unreal it becomes a Facebook business update You posted on all your social media is equally So what is the lowest common denominator is Instagram instagram will either take a photo no link or a video so that's traditionally the most basic thing that you can do so if you're just doing a market snapshot this week maybe it's just a screenshot put that screenshot in seven different places I don't want you to struggle to create something i'm asking you to create just one thing a week but my recommendation is when you're ready to execute it to put it out there in the ecosystem Have a tab group set up in Google



Are you Netflix's new neighbor what's happening in your neighborhood Easy things about neighborhood news like that was just low hanging fruit but there's lots of other examples here do you have a new employer moving into town do you have folks who are trying to be car free in your area or they're trying to allocate hey here the easiest transit options in and out of Mahwah boom there you go so when you're doing this you're gonna think about asking things is a question making a conversation though but make it easy for AI notice when you ask chat GPT things that loves bullet points so guess what you should use bullet points So if you have things use headers bullets and short paragraphs easy talk about other entities in the neighborhood is there a hospital are there new people moving for because the school opens things like that are there major employers landmarks or new opportunities going as the business development in your area always end with a call to action want to know more ask me call me email me visit here blah blah blah blah blah so start working in a call to action on your posts and again that's a question do you XYZ? So start thinking of that question mentality and that's something that will make it clear to AI that you're here to present information in a concise format now again the whole Idea 1 idea just come up with 1 item and you're gonna translate that multiple ways across your ecosystem Now here is where we talked about that source of truth and why we gave you that chat GPT prompt so you do want things to be uniform AI does not like inconsistencies when it's comparing data next to each other so I can't believe I have to talk about Yelp and Bing again these days but I do so things that I thought were long dead for 500 Alex so Bing is now Microsoft's resource for scanning the Internet So that is making a resurgence yelp is a primary resource for people to now get reviews on places because they have opened their database to AI scanning so if you're finding these if you're not on them guess what you should be so that's why we talk about standardizing your profile in the 1st place If you don't have a tick tock if you don't have yourself registered in Bing use your already established name address phone number email brokerage bio headshot all those things that we just set up in your Google business standardize all of that between all of the respective websites so that's your homework for example you probably already have a Zillow profile but you may not have updated in the last three years that's your homework is it standard to all the rest of your profiles so when we talk about optimizing your source of truth that's what i'm talking about


And that will enable you to just copy and paste time and time again to every new profiler every site that you exist now make sure that you include real estate specific sites homes.com realtor.com zillow.com or easily top three of the biggest ones open doors suburban jungle there's lots of other choices out there Go very see what else is going on there there's Agent Pronto there's Fast Expert there's all sorts of stuff in your community are you on next door Are you registered with your areas chamber of Commerce are you taking advantage of those forums and networking opportunities as well again if you post on the Pounds Chamber of Commerce website ultimately that will get scanned by Google or AI or something and that will add to your credibility as we're talking about this funny that's where I just ended because the next section is getting published where is your name published is it published so how can you get your name out there as a credible expert


Is a great place to interact with your community so any of these places where you can get bloated are you able to present a new news article to your local news desk Can you do anything to get yourself published as an authority now you'll see I do have you can host a podcast Yes podcasts don't have the exact same searchability quotients as most written material does so is podcasting great choice Anything in the written form definitely scores higher than can be scanned and indexed so anything that you can get especially in a journal or newspaper type scenario is definitely gonna help boost your relevance now I do realize this is a little bit of a higher lift you know not everyone's gonna run out and do this so it is gonna be your opportunity not maybe in the near future but look for those folks as your networking are they journalists are they podcasters are they publishers are they editors if you see one of those opportunities present themselves take the opportunity to jump in and say hey if you ever need any real estate content maybe I could send you a sample article to see if you'd like to run that and this is this a later edition so take those types of opportunities You just pay a little bit it's very easy to get published So any type of opportunity like that Full disclosure I don't any management here we do it with the real deal all the time we published after the real deal we just paid to have to publish it and guess what that increases our ranking tremendously because they're just a highly networked paper so anything that you need to do or any opportunity that you see present itself for getting published as a local authority will ultimately boom very well in your favor so a couple of examples here like what the public 5 key data points look at you maybe you're a data person you can do hey what are some interesting data points about this market to show it's shifting so if you're a local person there's a new employer in this area what's that mean for the local economy so anything like that that you can make yourself a hyper local resource and get published will expedite your growth of the top Now the key here is keeping a media press page for yourself as well now in the short term Facebook is the easiest way to accomplish that goal that's the most highly linked now ultimately and again this is a little advanced would you want to have your own press page on your own SEO website sure that's ultimately goal for us all Full disclosure it's our goal to bring our blog component online in the near future so we're gonna do the same exact thing we're going to set a place on our website where we can publish news as a published source so we're gonna use the same tactic ourselves So if you can get to whatever publishing that media means to you if at first that's just an update a social media post everywhere by all means take the win so if you can get anything published in tomorrow in the near future that's a great poster update to all of your social media sources as a quick aside linking an SCO searching works together the more time something is linked let's say 10 people like the same article That's considered more authority than someone who just links the article solo by themselves So if you can relink a published from Patch or The Real Deal for example you're sort of piggybacking on some of their SEO work as well and same with us you'd be piggybacking off of our website as well Now number six is a little easier we....to earth a little bit here so you too
 Now number six is a little easier we'll come back down to earth a little bit here so you too Now number six is a little easier we'll come back down to earth a little bit here so you tomorrow


Business Youtube is a Google product the more you use the two of them the more you will rank with Google everywhere SCO searching with Gemini with their own AI projects google will get you a lot of traction if you use both of these products together so I'm not asking for a but Michael Bay film OK i'm talking like 30 seconds folks 30 second video that's all I want that's my my my little taste of heaven here So using it as a Youtube short fantastic i'm totally fine with this do you have to do a 2 minute long video with a script and lighting no can you do a 30 second Youtube short use it on Youtube you can use it on Instagram you can use it on Facebook if you keep it nice and short like that you can just simply send it out everywhere Ultimately you are gonna take that video record it and send it to seven different places so ultimately Youtube is just gonna be one of those destinations that you send it to however the bonus is when you link the video to your Google Business update that's how you create that bridge so when you post that in Youtube you can then take that link take that corresponding video make that your Google Business update and you get twice the points for your effort essentially So I know you all are going to groan at me when I say this but you should all have a Youtube channel and be using it next easy again 30 seconds folks easy what's it like living in this neighborhood what's the vibe what are the amenities what's the community like what's the park situation like Shameless plug i'm a huge dog person as you know for my training because it's always my dogs so what's it like owning a dog in this city where are the best dog parks who has great dog restaurants what's been your experience having a dog in this area Easy easy things folks just come up with what you're experiencing what you'd like living in this area when you haven't liked living in this area which changed the most in this area these are all questions that make you the local authority answer that tell the public what your answers are on all of this and you may only get 10 news congratulations and then three videos later you get a 1000 views on that video for some reason well congratulations all your work is slowly starting to culminate and you're starting to build your authority as it goes so you're not just doing it for the 10 views on Youtube you're doing it for the 50 views on Facebook plus the 25 years on Linkedin plus the thirty views on Google Business plus the ten views on Youtube all for the same video and now you're starting to build your cohesive front Now I did say I hinted before the AI has a bias and I'm getting right towards the end I think I have two more slides after this so we're almost there so you will see that the newest wins I recommend month I'm sorry weekly because that keeps you in that sweet spot don't get me wrong no one has time to post daily I think unless you hire someone like Sir Han maybe that's the only way that happens so I'm just asking weekly 30 seconds video weekly folks so if you can stay on that type of schedule that will keep you inside of that recency bias so if something's a month out versus a week out AI will choose the week every single time so do you need to do it daily no do you need to do it more than monthly yes so try to find that happy middle ground there I do recommend weekly if you can pull it off so here's a quick example Weekly you're gonna do one social media post 2 everywhere Facebook Facebook Instagram Google Business next door Linkedin your line of tabs that hopefully will grow and get longer in time now I know that sounds like a burden but the idea here is that you package your product at the beginning you have your video for your photo you have your description you can run that through chat GPT to make it attractive and you simply use those two elements and rubber stamp them time and time again So you make that one video content item weekly and you put it everywhere one short one real 1 Facebook 1 Tiktok 1 Linkedin post so on and so forth biweekly now if you can do a more concise Youtube video maybe and I'm talking like 90 seconds to 2 1/2 minutes maybe try to do something like that monthly just to give you a what it's like living in this town biweekly that would be something that you could do all of your filming at one shot maybe you do a longer video and you simply cut it in parts and that's how you get your shorter video that's another way to think about that is the whole and then you can break it down into pieces monthly you could try doing a neighborhood snapshot email your market report your what's changed that type of monthly snapshot of information a quarterly a long form guide like here's what's new in 2025 here's what the trends have been year over year month over month this is how it's developed new projects here have been new developments maybe in the area what's new from this particular city so they're calling it a playbook That's something you could make as more as a long form guide maybe for buyers maybe for sellers maybe that's something you included Turf Report in something like that and again you're always gonna repurpose this with AI so once you've made the script once you've recorded a video ask AI not giving you some of those guidelines for example keeping it in the 750 character minimum you can just repeat that over and over again to make sure that you can use this to repackage your material time and time again And last but not least when in doubt what does AI do for you have you searched who is the best real estate agent in Mahwah to your chat agent who does it recommend what sources does it site this is constantly gonna change we talked about the fundamental ideas making yourself even making your data attractive to be scanned by AI but at some point in this information is gonna be stale it's gonna be changed So when in doubt just do it yourself give yourself the client experience when they're searching for the best agent what comes up when they're searching for you what comes up so when in doubt reverse engineer your own AI profile now AI knows you so in chat GPT you're gonna want to do a temporary chat you know you're not gonna want this to stick you're gonna try to wanna do this outside the system Maybe you want to have a friend do a search for you and say hey could you do me a favor just give this prompt to chat GPT and tell me when it spits out for you just send me a screenshot so whatever you're curious about just do it for yourself you'll see that some folks do your competition some folks may come back with a lot stronger instances on Zillow for example chat GBT now has a correct integration to Zillow you can shop listings in Chat GBT powered by Zillow for example so again what I'm telling you is gonna change and evolve in the near future but these are ideas that should make you the most attractive to the models even as they adapt moving forward I think oh I have one more slide sorry two more slides very short so here's another quick Sprint idea if you need some ideas



Take this term nap cleaning up all your profile data and making sure it's equal across the board so that means making everything is clean and consistent then we'll start to put that time and energy in deriving all of those posts so you can see here I haven't broken out by week sort of a quick recap of what I talked about before there is a quick addition to this if you're running a raffle something like that Facebook allows you to do polling that's a great style of engagement I actually love that 'cause it gets your client base something to do I would recommend that like you scanned at the beginning here with the QR code you can simply set up a custom lead form to have that same type of experience with all of that data capture just need you right back to your CRM and platform so just like I did I would recommend to create either the QR code or the link to the custom lead form and that's the link that you can use in your social media posts and last but not least here's the end folks you're not trying to outsmart chat GPT You're trying to stay relevant to chat GPT that's sort of the way to think about all of this how are you offering yourself as attractive understandable across all of the Internet and as is a bonus to all of this I know this class is geared for AI responses but ultimately you're doing this for all searching this this topic is long overdue no one just wanted to sit there and clean up profiles just to make my Google search better but now with AI being the topic it's motivating folks to actually get in there and sort of do that data back and work to make themselves more attractive So ultimately the take away here ultimately make your source of truth the same everywhere google Zillow Christie all of it make sure it's equal everywhere and reflective of you everywhere use this channel I sent you this is the script I sent you make your review scripts and make your reviews hyper local as you publish your content make it hyper local as well OK that's it folks congratulations I finished early that never happens
 OK that's it folks congratulations I finished early that never happens OK that's it folks congratulations I finished early that never happens


=====================================
There will be pending verification there is a button that will then say GET verified if it did not work for you for whatever reason



So Google and Zillow are both verified reviews those can only come from people on that system so traditionally people aren't going to give you the same review in Tudor There are exceptions to that rule If you know they have both you can always offer both links you can just say here is Google who is your Zillow and they can choose their own adventure they can pick whichever one there is another tactic for let's say someone left you a Zillow review and you would like that review on Google well take my coaching tips take those workout your script for that and simply include what they already wrote if they made it if you make it easy for them to copy and paste what they've already written then they're going to be much more inclined to literally copy paste and hit submit with very little work on their part now that could be a nice job to say hey this is a fantastic review would you mind just adding that I was representing you as the buyer and there you go they can just add a few words and they now give you a 2nd review that's even more detailed than the first so that's all based on that script however you're asking for that hyper local review you may develop 2 1 for brand new who's never left your review or one that's given you a review in some other form and you want to adapt it to a different place So that's sort of the advanced build up on that one but by default you only get Google to Google Zillow to Zillow now we in platform when we talked about testimonials we don't care and we will take it from any source we are not thinking but there was Tuesday sources are Google and Zillow are verified review sources Back now I just blocked it after I loaded it sorry OK there you Go


-----------------------------------------
Ohio or anything like that so since we're talking about my synergy so in the I'm pretty sure it's in marketing let me just go through here and actually double check over here yes so in marketing if you need to update anything on the Christie's website if your phone number changed if you want to use a different headshot if you want to tweak wording on your bio so our system controls my sire G the group website the corporate website and everything that's called So our source of truth is pretty expensive now so if we need to change something select agent profile updates and just drop in here whatever we need to change I'm pretty sure I listed yeah so this is for all syergy syndicated systems just understand that if you're requesting it from us it is for christies


The same in every single place So for Christie's stuff go to Marketing support and the request is let me just pop it open here one more time it is update agent profile update right here so just to show you it is breaking agent profile update so like


Correct in in platform we will not allow you to change you can change your phone number but we won't let you change your title your name your email your headshot or your bio without approval yeah Yel OK i'm officially going to stop the recording I did well


---------------------


And then of course I'll Jesus news the video is done transcribed and oh and just a Note 2 for the next format so this was all of November so November that was three days day one day two a platform and day 3 was this sort of mixed bag so that the same format is now going to be replicated every month moving forward so if you missed day one and day 2 you can come to December is day one and day 2 and it's all gonna stagger and be the same information they want today 3 repeated every single one so if you're brand new if you missed the day if you wanna catch up on a day if you wanna re here a day they're all all day one day 2 day threes are gonna be the same and they're gonna be repeated on a monthly consistent basis so that will be posted in the company events section and I will be posting those later today as soon as I finish up

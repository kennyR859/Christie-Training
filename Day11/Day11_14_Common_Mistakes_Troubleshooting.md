## The Top 10 Fatal Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Using Christie's Name in Google Business

**The Error:**
```
❌ Business Name: John Smith - Christie's International Real Estate
❌ Business Name: Christie's - John Smith
❌ Business Name: John Smith, Christie's Realtor
```

**Why It's Fatal:**
- Violates Google Business policies
- Legally required to change by broker
- Triggers re-verification if changed
- Loses all reviews if you have to create new profile

**Correct Format:**
```
✅ John Smith - Realtor
✅ John Smith - Licensed Real Estate Agent
✅ John Smith - Real Estate Agent
```

**How to Check:**
Log into Google Business → See business name → If Christie's is in it, you have a problem

**How to Fix:**
1. Edit business name immediately
2. Remove any brokerage reference
3. May trigger verification again
4. Update name everywhere else to match

> "If you put Christie's in your business name, I legally have to come to you and ask you to change it. This is representing YOU, not us."

---

### Mistake #2: Using Home Address on Google Business

**The Error:**
```
❌ Address: 456 Residential Lane, Mahwah, NJ 07430 (your home)
```

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Your home address becomes public on internet
- Security risk
- Looks unprofessional
- Can't change easily without re-verification

**Correct Approach:**
```
✅ Address: 123 Main Street, Suite 200, Mahwah, NJ 07430
(Christie's office address)
```

**Rationale:**
- This is where your license resides
- Where you host clients, closings, meetings
- Legal business address
- Professional appearance

> "Do not enter your home address. Even though this represents you, I do not want your home address published to everyone on the Internet. That is a security risk."

---

### Mistake #3: Wrong Google Business Category

**The Error:**
```
❌ Category: Real Estate Agency (that's the brokerage)
❌ Category: Real Estate Brokerage (that's Christie's)
❌ Category: Business Consultant
```

**Why It Matters:**
- AI searches by category
- Wrong category = you won't appear in relevant searches
- Competitors in correct category outrank you

**Correct Category:**
```
✅ Category: Real Estate Agent

How to select:
1. Start typing "real estate agent"
2. Select from dropdown
3. Must click dropdown option (typing alone doesn't save)
```

> "You must select real estate agent. There are no other choices available to you. That is what you are."

---

### Mistake #4: Uploading Photos in Wrong Sequence

**The Error:**
Uploading photos randomly, or skipping cover/logo, or uploading storefront first

**Why It's Fatal:**
Photos never display correctly and can't be fixed except by deleting and re-uploading in correct order

**Correct Sequence:**
```
Step 1: Cover Photo (Christie's red wide logo)
        ↓
Step 2: Logo (Your headshot, square)
        ↓
Step 3: Storefront Photo (Office exterior)
        ↓
Step 4+: Any additional photos
```

> "This is a Google secret. You will not see this posted anywhere. I've done thousands of these, and I can tell you: you MUST upload photos 1 and 2 before anything else, or these photos never set correctly."

**How to Fix If Already Wrong:**
- Delete ALL photos
- Wait 24 hours
- Upload in correct sequence
- Only fix this will work

---

### Mistake #5: Inconsistent NAP Across Platforms

**The Error:**
```
Google Business: (201) 555-1234
Facebook: 201-555-5678
Zillow: 201.555.9999
LinkedIn: +1 201 555 1234

Google Business: 123 Main St
Facebook: 123 Main Street, Suite 200
Zillow: 123 Main St., Mahwah
```

**Impact:**
AI sees conflicting information → Filters you to bottom of recommendations

**How to Detect:**
Google yourself + your business → See different phone numbers or addresses

**How to Fix:**
1. Create NAP master template (one source of truth)
2. Audit all platforms
3. Update everything to match exactly
4. Use copy/paste to ensure consistency

> "When AI scans these websites and sees conflicting information, you get filtered to the bottom of the pile."

---

### Mistake #6: Generic, Unhelpful Reviews

**The Error:**
```
❌ "John was great! 5 stars!"
❌ "Highly recommend!"
❌ "Very professional and knowledgeable."
```

**Why It's Wasteful:**
- AI extracts zero useful information
- No location data
- No price points
- No specifics about expertise
- Might as well not exist for AI purposes

**Correct Review (AI Optimized):**
```
✅ "John helped us buy our dream home in the Fardale
section of Mahwah for $850K. He knew the Ramapo school
district inside out, provided excellent comps from the
Franklin Turnpike area, and made our first-time buying
experience smooth. Closed in 45 days!"
```

**What AI Extracts:**
- Location: Fardale, Mahwah, Franklin Turnpike
- School: Ramapo district
- Price: $850K
- Client type: First-time buyers
- Transaction speed: 45 days

**How to Fix:**
Coach future clients on what to include in reviews (see Day11_04)

---

### Mistake #7: Monthly (or Less Frequent) Posting

**The Error:**
```
Week 1: No post
Week 2: No post
Week 3: No post
Week 4: Posted!
Week 5-8: No posts
Week 9: Posted again
```

**Impact:**
AI's recency bias filters you out 75%+ of the time

**Correct Frequency:**
```
Week 1: Post Monday ✅
Week 2: Post Monday ✅
Week 3: Post Monday ✅
Week 4: Post Monday ✅
Every week: Consistent presence
```

**Why Weekly Beats Monthly:**
```
Monthly: Visible 25% of time
Weekly: Visible 100% of time
AI Recommendation Rate: 3-4x higher with weekly
```

**How to Fix:**
- Set Monday morning calendar reminder
- Batch create 4 weeks of content (Day11_10)
- Use scheduling tools
- Make it non-negotiable routine

> "If something's a month out versus a week out, AI will choose the week every single time."

---

### Mistake #8: Asking for Generic Reviews

**The Error:**
```
"Hey, would you mind leaving me a 5-star Google review?
Thanks!"

Result: Generic review with no useful info
```

**Correct Approach:**
```
"Would you be willing to leave me a Google review?
The key things that would really help are mentioning:
• The neighborhood (Fardale section of Mahwah)
• The approximate price point
• How I helped you through the process
• Any specific aspects you appreciated

Here's my link: [URL]"

Result: Hyper-local, AI-optimized review
```

**How to Fix:**
- Send follow-up to past clients with guidance
- Coach future clients before they write
- Provide examples of helpful reviews

---

### Mistake #9: Creating Different Content for Each Platform

**The Error:**
```
Monday: Create Facebook post (30 min)
Tuesday: Create Instagram post (30 min)
Wednesday: Create LinkedIn post (30 min)
Thursday: Burnt out, quit posting

Result: Burnout, inconsistency, failure
```

**Efficient Approach:**
```
Monday: Create ONE piece of content (30 min)
         Post to ALL 7 platforms (15 min)
         Total: 45 minutes

Result: 7x the reach, sustainable, consistent
```

**How to Fix:**
- Stop creating platform-specific content
- Create once, adapt slightly, distribute everywhere
- Use multi-platform distribution system (Day11_11)

---

### Mistake #10: Checking "Get News" or Ad Boxes During Setup

**The Error:**
During Google Business setup, checking boxes for:
```
❌ "Send me tips and news"
❌ "Google Marketing Platform updates"
❌ "$500 Google Ads credit - sign up now!"
```

**Impact:**
- Spam emails forever
- Boxes have nothing to do with verification
- Distraction from actual setup

> "This is super deceptive. If you'd like to get spam, check those boxes. They have nothing to do with your Google Business coming online."

**How to Fix:**
- Uncheck all boxes
- Focus only on verification steps
- Ignore ad offers unless you want to advertise

---

## Platform-Specific Troubleshooting

### Google Business Issues

**Issue: "We noticed other businesses match this address"**

**Cause:** Multiple agents at same office creating profiles

**Solution:**
- Select "None of these" or "It does not match"
- Continue with YOUR business setup
- Do NOT try to claim Christie's profile

**Issue: Video verification required**

**Cause:** New office location, new account, or flagged activity

**Solution:**
- Film 3-minute video showing:
  - Office exterior
  - Christie's signage
  - Your business card
  - Interior office space
  - Verbal identification
- Keep under 3 minutes
- Show all required elements

**Issue: Verification code not received**

**Solutions:**
- **Text/Call:** Wait 10 minutes, check phone number correct, try alternative method
- **Email:** Check spam folder, wait 30 minutes, request resend
- **Postcard:** Wait full 14 business days, check with office manager, request new if lost

---

### Facebook Business Page Issues

**Issue: Can't create business page**

**Cause:** Don't have personal Facebook account

**Solution:**
- Must have personal account first
- Then create business page from personal account
- Business page is separate from personal profile

**Issue: Page not showing in search**

**Cause:** Page not published or privacy settings wrong

**Solution:**
- Settings → General → Page Visibility → Page published: YES
- Settings → Privacy → Public

**Issue: Can't verify page (blue checkmark)**

**Cause:** Verification only for notable public figures/brands

**Solution:**
- You likely don't qualify (and don't need it)
- Focus on completing profile and getting reviews
- Gray checkmark not available for individuals

---

### LinkedIn Issues

**Issue: Profile seems hidden**

**Cause:** Privacy settings limiting visibility

**Solution:**
- Settings → Visibility → Profile viewing options → Public
- Settings → Visibility → Edit public profile → Customize URL
- Make profile visible to everyone

**Issue: Can't publish long-form article**

**Cause:** Feature not available on mobile app

**Solution:**
- Use desktop LinkedIn (linkedin.com)
- Click "Write article" from home feed
- Articles only work on desktop currently

---

### Zillow/Realtor.com Issues

**Issue: Can't claim profile**

**Cause:** Profile already claimed by someone else or doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Contact Zillow/Realtor.com support
- Provide license number
- May take 3-5 business days

**Issue: Reviews not showing**

**Cause:** Reviews disabled or need platform verification

**Solution:**
- Contact platform support
- Verify you're the account owner
- Enable review functionality

---

## Content Creation Troubleshooting

### Issue: "I don't know what to post"

**Solution:**
Use the 4-week rotation:
- Week 1: Neighborhood spotlight
- Week 2: Market update
- Week 3: Community content (top 5 list)
- Week 4: Value content (tips/advice)

Use 52-week content library (Day11_10) for specific ideas

---

### Issue: "I don't have time"

**Solutions:**
- **Batch create:** 2 hours on Sunday = 4 weeks of content
- **Use templates:** Fill-in-the-blank = 5 minutes per post
- **Simplify:** Photo + caption is fine (don't need video every week)
- **Schedule:** Use Creator Studio to auto-post

Minimum viable: 30 minutes Monday morning for weekly post to all platforms

---

### Issue: "Video makes me uncomfortable"

**Solutions:**
- **Start with photos:** Build comfort over weeks 1-4
- **Practice privately:** Record without posting for weeks 5-8
- **Post when ready:** It gets easier after first one
- **Alternative:** Screen recordings of maps/data instead of face-to-camera
- **Voiceover:** Record separately and add to photos/b-roll

---

### Issue: "My content gets no engagement"

**Diagnosis & Fixes:**

**Low Views:**
- ✅ Post when audience is active (test 7am vs 12pm vs 6pm)
- ✅ Use hashtags (5-15 relevant tags)
- ✅ Geotag posts with location
- ✅ Engage with others' content before posting yours

**No Comments:**
- ✅ Ask questions at end of posts
- ✅ Create polls/quizzes
- ✅ Share controversial (but professional) opinions
- ✅ Respond to every comment to encourage more

**No Leads:**
- ✅ Add hyper-local content (name specific streets/schools)
- ✅ Include clear call to action with phone number
- ✅ Offer specific value (not just "call me")
- ✅ Build trust over time (3-6 months before seeing leads)

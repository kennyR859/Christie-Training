# Day 11 - Topic 02: Photo Upload Strategy & Sequence

## Overview

The photo upload sequence for Google Business Profile is **CRITICAL** - and getting it wrong means starting over. This guide reveals the insider "secret" sequence that ensures your photos display correctly across Google's ecosystem.

**Why This Matters:**
- Photos must be uploaded in a specific order or they never display correctly
- Wrong sequence = photos appear in wrong places or not at all
- Only two options: get it right the first time, or delete everything and start over
- This information is not published anywhere in Google's official documentation

> "This is a Google secret. You will not see this posted anywhere. I've done thousands of these, and I can tell you: you MUST upload photos 1 and 2 before anything else, or these photos never set correctly."

---

## The Critical Three-Photo Sequence

### Why Sequence Matters

**Google's Photo System Is Broken (But Predictable):**
- If you upload in the wrong order, photos never properly assign
- The system doesn't show errors - it just fails silently
- Once broken, you cannot fix it by re-uploading
- Only solution: delete all photos and start completely over

**The Secret:**
> "You have to land Photo 1 and Photo 2 before you do anything else, or these photos never set correctly."

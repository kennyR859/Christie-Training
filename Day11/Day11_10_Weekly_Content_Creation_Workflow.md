## Why Weekly Content Matters

### The Recency Bias Reality

**AI Prioritization Timeline:**

| Content Age | AI Priority | Recommendation Likelihood |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **0-7 days** | HIGHEST | Maximum visibility |
| **8-14 days** | HIGH | Strong visibility |
| **15-30 days** | MEDIUM | Moderate visibility |
| **31-90 days** | LOW | Reduced visibility |
| **90+ days** | MINIMAL | Filtered out |

> "If something's a month out versus a week out, AI will choose the week every single time."

**Your Goal:** Always have content in the 0-7 day window

**Solution:** Post weekly minimum

### Monthly vs. Weekly Posting Comparison

Week 1: No new content (AI sees: inactive)
Week 2: No new content (AI sees: inactive)
Week 3: No new content (AI sees: inactive)
Week 4: Posts content (AI sees: active for 7 days)

Result: Visible 25% of the time
AI Recommendation Rate: LOW
```

**Agent B: Weekly Posting**
```
Week 1: Posts content (AI sees: active)
Week 2: Posts content (AI sees: active)
Week 3: Posts content (AI sees: active)
Week 4: Posts content (AI sees: active)

Result: Visible 100% of the time
AI Recommendation Rate: HIGH (3-4x Agent A)

## Troubleshooting Common Workflow Issues

### Issue 1: "I Don't Know What to Post"

**Solution:**
- Use the 4-week rotation (neighborhood/market/community/value)
- Pull from 52-week content library above
- Look at what competitors post (then make yours better)
- Ask ChatGPT: "Give me 5 real estate social media post ideas for [your area]"

---

### Issue 2: "I Don't Have Time"

**Solution:**
- Batch create 4 weeks of content in one session
- Use templates (fill in blanks = 5 minutes)
- Simplify: Photo + caption is fine (don't need video every week)
- Delegate: VA can distribute content across platforms

---

### Issue 3: "My Content Isn't Getting Engagement"

**Solution:**
- Add more hyper-local content (name specific streets, schools)
- Ask questions at end of posts
- Respond to every comment quickly
- Post when your audience is active (test different times)
- Use video more (gets 3-5x engagement vs text)

---

### Issue 4: "Video Makes Me Uncomfortable"

**Solution:**
**Week 1-2:** Photo posts only (build comfort)
**Week 3-4:** Record video, don't post (practice)
**Week 5:** Post first video (it gets easier!)
**Alternative:** Use screen recordings of maps/data instead of face-to-camera

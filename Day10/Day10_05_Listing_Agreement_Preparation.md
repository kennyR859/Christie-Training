# Day 10 - Topic 05: Listing Agreement Preparation

## Overview

The Residential Listing Agreement is the foundational legal document establishing the agency relationship between seller and broker. Proper preparation and execution of this agreement protects both the agent's commission rights and the seller's interests while ensuring regulatory compliance. This comprehensive guide covers every section of the listing agreement, best practices for completion, and strategies for professional presentation to sellers.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the two types of listing agreements and why one is superior
- Master each section of the Residential Listing Agreement form
- Implement exclusive listing strategy for marketing preparation
- Execute listing appointments efficiently with pre-filled forms
- Protect commission rights through proper documentation
- Navigate required disclosures and legal compliance

## Types of Listing Agreements

### Exclusive Right to Sell (RECOMMENDED)

**Definition:**
The broker is entitled to commission regardless of who sells the property—whether the listing broker, another cooperating broker, or even the seller themselves finds the buyer.

**Why This is Standard:**
- **Complete broker protection:** Commission earned no matter the source of buyer
- **Industry standard:** What Christie's and most reputable brokerages use exclusively
- **Seller understanding:** Aligns broker and seller interests toward successful sale
- **Legal clarity:** No ambiguity about commission entitlement

**Commission Protection Clause:**
> "The broker agrees to pay the broker a compensation of [X]% if the compensation is a percentage, it shall be a percentage of the offering price or any other sales price accepted by the seller. The compensation shall be earned by the broker and payable to the broker if the property is sold by the seller, the broker, or through any other source during the term of this exclusive right to sell."

**Real-World Protection:**

**Scenario:**
- You list property as exclusive right to sell
- Seller's neighbor knocks on door with interested buyer
- Neighbor doesn't call broker, deals directly with seller
- Seller calls you: "I got somebody here who wants to buy it. Do I have to pay you a commission because I kind of got them myself?"

**Answer:**
> "Yes, you do. That's what that paragraph protects you."

Even though seller found buyer directly, broker still entitled to full commission because of exclusive right to sell agreement.

### Exclusive Agency (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Definition:**
Seller retains the right to sell the property themselves without paying commission. Broker only receives commission if broker or another agent brings the buyer.

**Why to AVOID:**

**Instructor's Direct Guidance:**
> "Never click that EA."

**Problems with Exclusive Agency:**
1. **Broker not protected** if seller finds buyer
2. **Seller incentivized** to circumvent broker
3. **Marketing investment at risk** if seller closes with self-found buyer
4. **Commission disputes** more likely
5. **Not industry standard** for residential real estate

**When EA Might Appear:**
- Seller requests it (don't agree—explain why exclusive right to sell protects everyone)
- Agent clicks wrong box by mistake (carefully review before submission)
- Commercial real estate (different standards, not residential)

**Proper Response if Seller Requests EA:**
"I understand you're thinking about that, but the industry standard is Exclusive Right to Sell because it aligns our interests completely. I'm going to invest significant time and money marketing your property—professional photos, advertising, open houses, showing coordination. The Exclusive Right to Sell protects that investment and ensures I'm motivated to get you the best price and terms, regardless of who brings the buyer. It's really the best arrangement for both of us."

## Residential Listing Agreement Form Structure

### Property Information Section

#### Property Address
**What to Include:**
- Street number and name
- Town/municipality
- State and ZIP code
- Unit number (if condo or townhouse)

**Investment Property Consideration:**
> "Why is the owner's address different? It's because it could be an investment property."

**Owner's Address:**
- May differ from property address
- Required for all correspondence and legal notices
- Confirm seller's preferred mailing address

#### Listing Broker and Agent Information

**Auto-Population in Platform:**
- **Listing Broker ID:** Christie's International Real Estate (auto-fills)
- **Salesperson ID:** Your agent ID number (auto-fills)

**Why This Matters:**
- Platform (Christie's CRM) already has your information on file
- Automatically populates when you initiate listing agreement
- Reduces errors and speeds up form completion
- Ensures proper commission routing

**Manual Entry (if not using Platform):**
- Broker company name and license number
- Agent name and license number
- Office address and contact information

### Agency Disclosure Section

#### Agent Role Selection

**Three Options (Select One):**

1. **Seller's Agent Only**
   - Limited scope, rare in practice
   - Broker represents seller exclusively
   - No dual agency permitted under any circumstances

2. **Transaction Broker**
   - Neutral facilitator
   - Not commonly used in New Jersey residential
   - Limited fiduciary duties

3. **Seller's Agent and Disclosed Dual Agent if Opportunity Arises** ✅ **BEST CHOICE**

**Why Disclosed Dual Agent is Critical:**

**Instructor's Explanation:**
> "If you don't do that, nobody else at Christie's can sell it. Has to be Seller's agent and disclosed dual agent."

**Dual Agency Scenario:**
- Another Christie's agent has buyer interested in your listing
- With proper dual agency authorization: Transaction can proceed
- Without dual agency authorization: Deal is blocked, must refer buyer elsewhere
- **Disclosed = All parties informed and consent**

**How It Works:**
1. You list property as seller's agent with dual agency authorization
2. Another office agent has buyer who loves property
3. Both seller and buyer sign dual agency disclosure
4. All parties understand agent(s) represent both sides
5. Transaction proceeds with full transparency

**Critical Requirement:**
- Dual agency disclosure MUST be signed by all parties
- Cannot proceed as dual agent without written consent
- Full transparency required about representation

#### Cooperation Type

**Two Cooperation Options:**

**Co-op (Cooperating with Other Brokers):**
- Standard when ready to launch on MLS
- Other brokers can show property and bring buyers
- Commission split with cooperating broker
- Normal listing status

**Non-Cooperating (Exclusive to Your Office):**
- Temporary status during marketing prep period
- Only your office agents can show property
- Use during exclusive listing period (10 days to 1 month)
- Transition to co-op when ready to fully launch

### Property Details Section

#### Bedrooms and Bathrooms

**Critical for Septic Properties:**
- Bedroom count must match septic system capacity
- Verify with OPRA report if septic system exists
- Full bathrooms vs. half bathrooms (3/4 bath if shower only)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Counting office or den as bedroom (needs closet and egress)
- Incorrect full vs. half bath designation
- Not verifying bedroom count against septic capacity

**Best Practice:**
Walk through property and physically count:
- Rooms with closets and proper egress = bedrooms
- Full bath (sink, toilet, tub/shower)
- Half bath (sink and toilet only)
- Verify count matches seller's understanding

#### Solar Panels

**Two Critical Questions:**

1. **Are solar panels Owned or Leased?**
   - **Owned:** Asset of property, transfers with sale
   - **Leased:** Liability, buyer must assume lease or seller must buy out

2. **If Leased:**
   - Lease term remaining
   - Monthly payment amount
   - Transfer requirements
   - Buyout cost (if seller considering)

**Disclosure Requirement:**
- Must disclose solar panel lease in listing
- Buyers need to qualify for lease assumption
- Lease payments affect buyer's debt-to-income ratio
- Can impact financing approval

#### Property Style and Sub-Style

**Style Selection:**

**Common Style Categories:**
> "When you're in the computer it'll say two-story, it'll say colonial."

- **Two Story** - Two full floors of living space above grade
- **Colonial** - Traditional symmetrical design, typically two stories
- **Ranch** - Single-story home
- **Cape Cod** - 1.5 stories with dormers
- **Split Level** - Staggered floor levels
- **Bi-Level** - Two levels, entry between floors

**Sub-Style (Where It Gets Complicated):**

**Instructor's Guidance:**
> "Google all the different styles of homes. The sub-style is where it gets a little crazy. You could have a two-story home or a colonial home that has the style of a Tudor. Tudor's not necessarily the type of home it is, it's more like the sub-style."

**Sub-Style Examples:**
- **Tudor** - Architectural details: exposed beams, stucco, steep roofs
- **Contemporary** - Modern design elements, clean lines
- **Mediterranean** - Stucco exterior, tile roof, arches
- **Farmhouse** - Rural aesthetic, wrap-around porch
- **Craftsman** - Arts and crafts movement, detailed woodwork
- **Victorian** - Ornate details, turrets, varied rooflines

**How to Determine Sub-Style:**
1. Google property style definitions with images
2. Look at exterior architectural features
3. Compare to similar homes in MLS
4. Ask seller what style they consider it
5. When in doubt, use primary style only

**Example:**
- **Style:** Two Story
- **Sub-Style:** Tudor (if half-timbering, stucco, steep roof)

OR

- **Style:** Colonial
- **Sub-Style:** Contemporary (if modern updates, clean aesthetic)

#### Floor Breakdown

**Understanding Floor Designations:**

**Ground Floor:**
- Used for **bi-level homes**
- Entry level at grade
- Typically family room, laundry, garage access

**1st Floor:**
- Main living level in most homes
- Living room, dining room, kitchen
- Primary gathering spaces
- Half bath typically located here

**2nd Floor:**
- **Colonials and two-stories:** Bedroom level
- Master/primary bedroom suite
- Additional bedrooms
- Full bathrooms

**3rd Floor:**
- **Older homes:** Tudor, farmhouse styles
- Finished attic space with bedrooms
- "The stairway still goes up to [it] which was the attic but it's called 3rd floor because [it's] totally finished"
- Not common in modern construction

**Basement:**
- **Total Finished** - Entire basement finished and habitable
- **Partially Finished** - Some areas finished, some unfinished
- Note bedroom and bathroom count if applicable

**Entry Tip:**
Walk through home and note which rooms are on which floor, then input accurately to MLS.

#### Items Included and Items Not Included

**Be Specific:**

**Items Typically Included:**
- All kitchen appliances (refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, microwave)
- Washer and dryer
- Window treatments (blinds, shades—specify if curtains excluded)
- Light fixtures (note any chandeliers excluded)
- Built-in shelving
- Garage door openers and remotes
- Outdoor equipment attached to property (swing set if anchored)

**Items Typically Excluded:**
- Specific chandelier with sentimental value
- High-end appliances seller is keeping
- Custom window treatments
- Portable items (not attached to property)
- Decorative items (mirrors, artwork)

**Related to Contract Line 108:**
This listing agreement section corresponds to Contract Line 108 (covered in Day 4 training). What you list here should match what appears in purchase contract.

**Negotiable Items:**
- Mark items as "negotiable" if seller willing to discuss
- Example: "Refrigerator - negotiable"
- Allows flexibility during offer negotiations

**Best Practice:**
> "Make sure you're specific."

Don't leave this vague. Walk through home with seller and create specific list of included/excluded items to prevent disputes.

#### Easements

**What Are Easements?**
Legal rights for others to use portion of property for specific purpose:
- Utility easements (electric, gas, water, sewer lines)
- Access easements (neighbor's driveway crosses property)
- Conservation easements (land use restrictions)
- Drainage easements (water flow management)

**Seller Often Doesn't Know:**

**Typical Seller Response:**
> "Do you have any easements? I don't know, I have no idea."

**How to Find Easement Information:**

**Research Sources (In Order of Reliability):**

1. **Survey** (Most Accurate)
   - Shows easement locations on property map
   - Indicates easement type and dimensions
   - Legal description of easement purpose
   - **Request:** "Do you have a copy of your survey?"

2. **Deed** (Legal Documentation)
   - Easement language in property deed
   - Legal rights granted or reserved
   - May be difficult for layperson to interpret

3. **Title Company** (Most Reliable for Current Status)
   - Title search reveals all recorded easements
   - Confirms which easements are active
   - Identifies any easements that can be removed
   - **Best Practice:** "The title company would really know"

4. **Town/Municipality** (Public Records)
   - Utility easement records
   - Public access easements
   - May require OPRA request

**Easements That Can Be Removed:**

**Example Scenario:**
> "I had a property, it was a corner lot here and there was another lot back there and there was actually a road originally that went to the back and they removed that road. They decided not to have that road there. So they were like easements roads that don't exist. So and they're gone."

**Process:**
- Old survey shows easement for road that was never built
- Road no longer planned, easement defunct
- Title company confirms easement can be removed
- Property sold without that easement burden

**Corner Lot Easements:**
- Two possible road frontages
- Easement may exist for access to rear lots
- Original subdivision plans show intended use
- Title company validates if easement still necessary

**How to Handle on Listing Form:**
- If easements known: List them specifically
- If seller doesn't know: Leave blank OR write "Unknown - see survey and title"
- Recommend seller locate survey before listing
- Order title search if uncertain

#### Taxes

**Where to Find Tax Information:**

**Primary Source: MLS Property Search**
> "Go into the computer, go into search, and just look up the address of the property into your New Jersey MLS or whatever MLS and then look up the taxes on that house."

**Tax Information Available in MLS:**
- Current annual tax amount
- Assessment value (land and improvements)
- Square footage of property (land area)
- Square footage of building
- Lot dimensions (sometimes)
- Tax breakdown by category (municipal, county, school)

**Alternative Source: Realist Platform**
- More detailed property information
- Sometimes includes survey information
- School district data
- Tax assessment history over time
- Comparable property assessments

**Pre-Listing Research Process:**

**Best Practice:**
> "Before I go to a house to make my listing presentation, I look up the address on my on the MLS. I go into the taxes and see, get, print out the whole all the information on the taxes. It'll have the square footage of the property, it'll have square footage of the building, it'll have the assessment, it will have [everything]."

**What to Bring to Listing Appointment:**
- Printout of property tax information from MLS
- Assessment breakdown (land vs. improvements)
- Square footage data
- Lot size information
- Comparable property taxes in neighborhood

**Why This Matters:**
- Buyers ask about taxes immediately
- Tax burden affects affordability
- Assessment disputes may be pending
- Helps justify listing price
- Shows professional preparation

#### Lot Information

**Lot Square Footage:**
- Available in tax records
- MLS property search displays this
- Can calculate acreage:
  - 1/4 acre = 10,890 square feet
  - 1/2 acre = 21,780 square feet
  - 1 acre = 43,560 square feet

**Frontage:**

**Definition:**
> "Let's say this is the diagram of a lot and the house is right here, this is the street, this is the frontage. It's the length from here to here."

**What Frontage Means:**
- The property line facing the street where the address is located
- Measured in linear feet along the street
- Critical for zoning setback requirements
- Affects property value (more frontage often more valuable)

**Corner Lot Frontage:**

**Important Distinction:**
> "If it's on the corner of East Saddle River Road and East Allendale, the front of the house was on East Allendale. The frontage is always where the address is. So if it's 119 West Saddle River Road, the frontage is 119 Saddle River Road. If it's 204 East Allendale, that frontage is on that address."

**Not Necessarily Front Door:**
- Frontage based on address, not front entrance
- Corner lots have two street sides
- Frontage = street where address is assigned
- Other street side = side yard (not frontage)

**Finding Frontage Information:**
- **Survey:** Most accurate measurement
- **Tax records:** Rarely includes frontage (usually not listed)
- **MLS:** Can search by seller's name if address unclear
- **Realist:** Sometimes available

**Why Frontage Matters:**
- Zoning compliance (setback requirements)
- Future subdivision potential
- Property value calculation
- Variance applications if building additions

#### Schools

**School Assignment Considerations:**

**Schools Can Change:**
> "In Ridgewood for instance, this year you have probably 25 new kids going to Ridge School and next year there's 50, so they may divide a street off and put it to Orchard or something. They can move it all around."

**Proper Agent Response:**
- Provide current school assignments
- Include disclaimer: "These are what is now, it's possible it could change"
- Direct buyers: "Speak with the principal" for enrollment verification
- **DO NOT guarantee school assignments**

**Fair Housing Compliance:**

**What You CANNOT Say:**
- ❌ "This school is better than that school"
- ❌ Comparisons or rankings of school quality
- ❌ Demographic information about student population

**What You CAN Say:**
- ✅ Current school assignment for property address
- ✅ "You can find test scores and information on the school website"
- ✅ "Here's the principal's contact information"
- ✅ After buyer mentions children: "What age? I can connect you with parents who have kids in that grade"

**After Buyer Mentions Children:**
Once buyer brings up their children, you can discuss:
- Age-appropriate programs available
- Sports teams and extracurriculars
- Special education services (if they mention special needs)
- Before/after school care options
- Bus routes and transportation

**Research Tools:**
- **Realist platform:** School district information
- **School district websites:** Official enrollment areas
- **Tax records:** Sometimes include school assignment
- **Direct contact:** Call school district office to verify

**Best Practice:**
Prepare school information before listing appointment, but let buyers do their own research and verification with schools directly.

#### Municipal Assessments

**What Are Municipal Assessments?**
Special charges imposed by municipality for local improvements:
- New sidewalk installation or repair
- Road paving or repaving
- Sewer connection fees
- Street lighting installation
- Other infrastructure improvements

**How to Handle on Form:**

**Instructor's Guidance:**
> "I probably would leave that blank until I find out for sure, until I was absolutely sure. The seller might know that they—you can ask them: have you had anything like a new sidewalk? They might get assessed for that."

**Research Methods:**
1. **Ask seller directly:** "Have you had any recent municipal improvements? New sidewalk, road paving?"
2. **Check tax bills:** Assessments appear as separate line items
3. **Contact town:** Municipal clerk can verify pending assessments
4. **Title search:** Will reveal recorded assessments

**When to Include:**
- Only if confirmed with certainty
- Better to leave blank than guess
- Will be revealed in title search anyway

**Disclosure Importance:**
- Affects buyer's carrying costs
- May be significant expense ($3,000-$10,000+)
- Timeline for payment (lump sum or annual)
- Can be negotiating point in sale

## Listing Date and Expiration Date

### Listing Date

**Definition:**
The date the listing agreement is signed by seller and broker.

**MLS Upload Requirement:**
> "MLS requires that this state is has to be into the multiple within 24 hours."

**The Problem:**
If you upload listing to MLS within 24 hours of signing, you won't have:
- Professional photos
- Property brochure
- Social media campaigns set up
- "Just Listed" marketing cards
- Open house materials
- Time for any final preparations

**The Solution: Exclusive Listing Period**

### Exclusive Listing Strategy

**Why We Don't Upload to MLS Immediately:**

**Instructor's Explanation:**
> "We don't want to put our listings in 24 hours because who would have any pictures right? We wouldn't have a brochure, we wouldn't have any social media lined up, we wouldn't have anything done. Maybe we want to send out Just Listed cards, even digital ones. Maybe we want to do a whole bunch of stuff."

**The Strategy:**
1. Sign listing agreement on Day 1
2. Take listing as **"Exclusive Listing Agreement"** (not yet on public MLS)
3. Set status to **"Non-Cooperating"** initially
4. Gives you 10 days to 1 month for marketing preparation
5. Use **"Change of Status"** form to launch when ready

**Duration of Exclusive Period:**

**Standard: 10 Days**
- Sufficient for photo scheduling
- Marketing material creation
- Social media setup
- Property preparation

**Extended: 1 Month (If Repairs Needed)**
- Seller needs to paint or make improvements
- Landscaping work required
- Staging needs to be arranged
- Major preparations before showing

**During Exclusive Period:**
- Property IS in MLS (but hidden from public)
- Marked as "Office Exclusive" or "Non-Cooperating"
- Only your office can show (optional)
- You're preparing all marketing materials
- Professional photos ordered and organized
- Social media campaigns designed
- Marketing materials printed or designed

### Expiration Date

**Standard Term:**
- **6 months** from signing date
- Industry standard for residential listings
- Protects broker's marketing investment

**Exclusive Period vs. Expiration:**
- **Exclusive period:** 10 days to 1 month (marketing prep)
- **Expiration date:** Still 6 months from signing
- These are separate concepts
- Exclusive period is temporary status within overall listing term

**Example Timeline:**
- **November 18:** Listing agreement signed (6-month expiration = May 18)
- **November 18-December 18:** Exclusive listing period (1 month for seller to paint)
- **December 18:** Change of Status form activates, goes live on public MLS
- **May 18:** Listing agreement expires (6 months from signing)

## Exclusive Listing Strategy: Protecting Your Listing

### The "Sign Now, Launch Later" Approach

**Common Seller Request:**

**Seller Says:**
> "I'd like to list with you but I want to paint the living room before I put it on. Could you come back in a month and we'll list it?"

**WRONG Agent Response:**
"Okay, I'll come back in a month."

**Problems with Waiting:**
- Seller might list with different agent before you return
- Neighbor could bring buyer, seller signs with neighbor's agent
- Your consultation and preparation work wasted
- No legal protection of your listing rights

**RIGHT Agent Response:**

**Instructor's Script:**
> "That's great! That's perfect because that gives me time to prepare all the marketing I need to prepare before we truly launch it. Let's sign it now—gives you time to do what you want to do and me time to get my thing together. I can put it in the multiple as an exclusive without anybody seeing it, but I can't start my marketing and my photos and everything I need to do unless we sign this document."

**Why This Works:**
- **Protects agent:** Listing agreement signed, you're protected
- **Benefits seller:** They get time for improvements
- **Mutual advantage:** Both parties can prepare properly
- **Professional presentation:** Shows you understand marketing process
- **No pressure:** Frames as beneficial to both parties

### What Can Happen If You Wait

**Real-World Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Neighbor Brings Buyer**
- You consult with seller, agree to list in one month
- Week later, neighbor knocks with interested buyer
- Seller shows property, accepts offer
- You have no listing agreement, no commission
- Your consultation time completely wasted

**Scenario 2: Seller Lists with Someone Else**
- You prepare market analysis, discuss pricing strategy
- Seller says "let me think about it"
- Another agent calls, seller lists with them
- You provided free consultation, other agent gets listing

**Scenario 3: Property Sells Before You Return**
- Seller planning to list in one month after repairs
- During repairs, buyer knocks on door (saw For Sale sign from previous attempt)
- Seller sells directly without any agent
- You lose listing you were counting on

**Protection Through Exclusive Agreement:**
Once signed, you're protected from all these scenarios. Even if property sells during exclusive period, you're entitled to commission because of Exclusive Right to Sell agreement.

## Change of Status Form

### Purpose

The Change of Status form allows you to schedule the transition from "Office Exclusive" or "Non-Cooperating" status to full public MLS listing on a specific future date.

### How It Works

**Process:**

1. **Take Listing on November 18** (example)
   - Sign Residential Listing Agreement
   - Mark as "Exclusive Listing" or "Non-Cooperating"
   - Expiration: 6 months (May 18)

2. **Fill Out Change of Status Form**
   - Form available in Zip Forms and MLS
   - Specify transition date: January 5 (or whenever ready)
   - Submit form with original listing

3. **Marketing Preparation Period** (November 18 - January 5)
   - Order professional photography
   - Schedule photo shoot
   - Organize photos in logical walk-through order
   - Create property brochure
   - Set up social media campaigns
   - Design "Just Listed" marketing cards
   - Coordinate with marketing department
   - Prepare open house materials

4. **Automatic Status Change on January 5**
   - Change of Status form automatically activates
   - Listing goes live on public MLS
   - All marketing materials ready
   - Professional photos organized and uploaded
   - Ready for showings

**Timeline Control:**
You determine the launch date based on:
- How long marketing prep will take (typically 10 days)
- Seller's improvement timeline (painting, repairs)
- Strategic timing (avoid holidays, optimize market conditions)
- Property readiness

### Photo Organization Best Practices

**Logical Walk-Through Order:**

**Instructor's Guidance:**
> "You want to organize them as if you're walking through the house. Entry foyer, living room, dining room, family room, kitchen. You want it all to flow nicely as if somebody's really walking through the home."

**Proper Photo Sequence:**
1. **Exterior:** Front of house, curb appeal
2. **Entry:** Foyer, front door interior
3. **Main Level:** Living room → Dining room → Family room → Kitchen
4. **Upper Level:** Primary bedroom → Additional bedrooms → Bathrooms
5. **Basement:** (If finished) Recreation room, additional spaces
6. **Backyard:** Deck, patio, landscaping, pool

**Photos to Avoid:**

**Instructor's Advice:**
> "Sometimes bathrooms are so small that the picture is just a picture of a toilet. Why would you do that? You don't want to do that."

**Remove These Photos:**
- Tiny bathrooms where only toilet visible
- Cluttered or messy spaces
- Unflattering angles
- Dark rooms with poor lighting
- Blurry or low-quality images
- Photos that don't add value

**Photo Review Process:**
1. Photographer provides 50-80 photos
2. Review EVERY photo critically
3. Remove unflattering or unnecessary images
4. Organize remaining photos in walk-through order
5. Upload to MLS in proper sequence
6. Review how listing appears online before launching

## Broker Fee and Compensation

### How to Present Commission

**Pre-Fill Commission Amount:**

**Instructor's Strategy:**
> "This is what I do: I always put it in there already. I just stick it in there. Whatever you're asking, don't ask them, put it in."

**Why Pre-Fill:**
- Standard business practice
- Avoids awkward negotiation
- Presents as professional norm
- Seller can question if concerned
- Much easier than asking permission

**Typical Commission:**
- **6%** total (standard in many markets)
- Split between listing and selling broker (typically 3% each)
- May vary by market, property type, price point

**Commission Language in Agreement:**

**Standard Wording:**
> "The broker agrees to pay the broker a compensation of 6%. If the compensation is a percentage, it shall be a percentage of the offering price or any other sales price accepted by the seller."

**What This Means:**
- Commission based on final sale price (not just list price)
- If property sells for less than list, commission on actual sale price
- If property sells for more than list, commission on actual sale price
- Percentage applies to whatever price seller accepts

### When Commission is Earned

**Commission Triggers:**

The broker earns commission if property is sold by:
1. **The seller** (directly finding buyer)
2. **The broker** (listing agent finding buyer)
3. **Through any other source** (cooperating broker)

**Critical Requirement:**
Sale must occur **"during the term of this exclusive right to sell"**

**Protection Clause Example:**

**Scenario:**
> "Some wise guy goes and knocks on the door, doesn't call the broker, then the seller calls up and says 'Hey I got somebody here, they want to buy it. Do I have to pay you a commission because I kind of got them myself?' Yeah, you do. That's what that paragraph protects you."

**Why This Protection Matters:**
- Prevents seller from circumventing broker after marketing begins
- Protects broker's investment in advertising and promotion
- Ensures broker compensated for any sale during listing term
- Discourages seller from dealing directly with buyers who saw marketing

### Tail Provision (Post-Expiration Protection)

**Standard Language:**
> "In the event that the property or any part of it described in this agreement becomes subject to a written or other agreement and is transferred within [X] days after the expiration of this agreement to anyone..."

**What This Means:**

**Scenario:**
1. Listing expires on May 18
2. Buyer who saw property during listing term contacts seller on May 25
3. Buyer and seller enter contract on June 1
4. Broker still entitled to commission (if within tail period)

**Typical Duration:**
- **190 days** after expiration (most common)
- **365 days** after expiration (some brokers request)
- Negotiable between broker and seller

**Important Limitation:**

**Who is Covered:**
> "Somebody who saw it during the term of your listing, whether it was with you or another broker. If you want to pursue this, you do have to keep some records."

**Who is NOT Covered:**
- Buyer who never saw property during listing term
- Buyer introduced after listing expired
- New buyer with no connection to listing marketing

**Exception - Re-Listing:**

**When Tail Provision Does NOT Apply:**
> "If the seller re-lists with ABC Realty within like a day after your listing expired, they don't want to go back to you, they want to go to ABC Realty. All bets are off. That paragraph just means nothing on the listing side."

If seller immediately re-lists with another broker, tail provision generally doesn't apply (seller's right to choose new representation).

**Record Keeping for Tail Protection:**

To enforce tail provision, broker must document:
- Showing appointments during listing term
- All showings with dates and buyer names
- Email confirmations of showings
- Showing Time records
- Feedback from buyers who viewed property

**Best Practice:**
Keep detailed showing records for all listings to protect commission rights if tail provision needed.

## Possession Date

### Default Options

**Computer Default Ranges:**
- 1 to 30 days
- 30 to 60 days
- 60 to 90 days
- 90 to 120 days

**Most Common:**
- 30 to 60 days (standard closing timeline)
- Allows time for mortgage approval, inspections, attorney review

### Specific Date Requirements

**When Seller Has Specific Timeline:**

**Example:**
> "We have to be out of here, we bought a house already, we have to be out of here by whatever date."

**Where to Specify:**
- Under **"Additional Contractual Provisions"** section
- Write specific date if doesn't fit default ranges
- Example: "Possession required by August 15, 2024"

**Agent Caution on Specific Dates:**

**Instructor's Warning:**
> "I would never tell the world that because it makes it look like they're desperate to sell."

**Problem with Specific Dates:**
- Reveals seller urgency to buyers
- Weakens seller's negotiating position
- Invites lowball offers
- Suggests seller has timeline pressure

**Alternative Framing:**

Instead of: "Seller must be out by July 1"

Better: "Seller would prefer to have children registered in new school by [date]"

**Benefits:**
- Explains timing without showing desperation
- Frames as preference, not requirement
- Maintains seller's negotiating strength
- Provides context without revealing pressure

### Negotiation Strategy

**Best Approach:**
- Use default ranges whenever possible
- Avoid specific dates unless absolutely necessary
- Frame timing around practical considerations (school, job relocation)
- Never reveal seller's timeline pressure to market
- Protect seller's negotiating position

## Showing Instructions and Agent Remarks

### Showing Instructions (Not Public)

**Critical Understanding:**

**Instructor's Warning:**
> "This line is not for the public. That's why you never send—in fact the computer won't let you do it—but even if you print out a report, never give the buyers the full report because there's stuff in there that the listing agent has put in there that is not for public, not for the public to see."

**What Goes in Showing Instructions:**

**Internal Broker Communication:**
- How to schedule showings
- Special access instructions
- Timing restrictions
- Security information (NEVER specific location of hidden keys)

**Common Showing Instruction Examples:**

1. **Showing Time System:**
   > "Click Showing Time link in blue to schedule. System shows available times."

2. **Direct Contact:**
   > "Call listing broker at [phone]" or "Text listing broker at [phone]"

3. **Timing Restrictions:**
   > "No showings between 1-3 PM (baby's nap time)"
   > "No showings after 8 PM"
   > "24-hour notice required"

4. **Religious Restrictions:**
   > "No showings Friday evening through Saturday evening" (Sabbath observance)

5. **Access Method:**
   > "Key in lockbox" or "Appointment only, listing agent to accompany"

**What NOT to Include:**
- ❌ "Key under rock on third step" (security risk if buyers see)
- ❌ Specific security code (buyer agents only, not buyers)
- ❌ Seller's personal schedule (too much detail)
- ❌ Anything you wouldn't want buyer to see

### Showing Time System

**How Showing Time Works:**

**Instructor's Explanation:**
> "You click on Showing Time and you can play with it, just don't really schedule a showing. You click on Showing Time and you put your request in for the time you want. It will come up with Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and from 9:00 in the morning till whatever time at night, and it'll have little black things on it if it's not available where they block it out."

**Process:**
1. Buyer's agent clicks Showing Time link in listing
2. Calendar appears with available times
3. Blocked times shown in black (seller unavailable)
4. Agent selects desired time
5. Request sent to listing agent or seller
6. Confirmation or alternate time offered

**Information to Include in Showing Request:**

**Showing Time Best Practice:**
> "Put your name and contact info. NEVER put buyer's name in showing request."

**Why NOT Buyer's Name:**
- Privacy protection for buyer
- Prevents seller from contacting buyer directly
- Reduces risk of commission disputes

**Exception:**
> "If you have your buyer, if your buyer for sure signed the [buyer's] agreement, it's okay because that tracks that you showed the buyer there."

**If Buyer Agreement Signed:**
- Can include buyer name for tracking
- Documents you showed this buyer this property
- Protects your commission if dispute arises

**Alternative Tracking Method:**

**Email/Text After Showing:**
> "After you've left the home and you showed it to them, you would send an email to them or text them and say 'Just wondered how you felt about the house at 123 Main Street' and just leave it. Then you have [documentation]."

**Benefits:**
- Email/text creates timestamped record
- Buyer's response confirms showing occurred
- Protects your commission claim
- Doesn't reveal buyer identity prematurely

### Customer Remarks (Public Marketing)

**Purpose:**
Property description visible to all potential buyers on MLS, real estate websites, and marketing materials.

**Creating Compelling Descriptions:**

**Tools to Use:**
- **ChatGPT:** Generate professional property descriptions
- **Other MLS Listings:** Review well-written descriptions for formatting ideas
- **Property Brochures:** Study marketing language from high-end properties

**Example Structure:**
> "This lovely four bedroom colonial sits on a private expansive lot..."

**Description Components:**
1. **Opening statement:** Grab attention with key feature
2. **Home style and layout:** Describe architecture and flow
3. **Room highlights:** Kitchen, primary suite, special spaces
4. **Outdoor features:** Lot size, landscaping, deck, pool
5. **Location benefits:** Proximity to amenities (legally compliant)
6. **Closing appeal:** Emotional connection or unique selling point

**Fair Housing Compliance in Descriptions:**

**Prohibited Keywords:**

**Old (Prohibited):**
- ❌ "Master bedroom" → ✅ **"Primary bedroom"**
- ❌ "Walk to town" → ✅ **"Close proximity to town/shopping"**
- ❌ "Walk to schools" → ✅ **"Near schools"** or **"Close to schools"**

**Measurement Alternatives (ALLOWED):**
- ✅ "Two blocks from downtown"
- ✅ "Quarter mile to train station"
- ✅ "1/16th of a mile to shopping"
- ✅ "0.3 miles to schools"

**How to Provide Distance Information:**

**Use Google Maps:**
1. Enter property address
2. Measure distance to train station, shopping, schools
3. Use exact measurement in description
4. Specific numbers avoid vague "walk to" language

**Examples:**
- "Located just 0.2 miles from downtown shopping and dining"
- "Three blocks to Metro North station"
- "Half-mile to Blue Ribbon schools"
- "Close proximity to parks, shopping, and transportation"

### Walkability Research Tools

**Finding Homes Near Amenities:**

**Instructor's Guidance:**
> "You can go into Maps and see if there's any homes available within that little circle that you draw."

**Research Tools:**
1. **Google Maps:**
   - Measure exact distances
   - Draw radius circles around amenities
   - Identify homes within walking distance

2. **Turf/Platform:**
   - Mapping features in Platform CRM
   - Draw circles around property
   - Find comparable properties
   - Identify nearby listings

3. **Walk Score Websites:**
   - Third-party walkability ratings
   - Can reference scores in marketing

**Special Buyer Needs Example:**

**Instructor's Story:**
> "I had one customer, the wife absolutely refused to drive. She did not want to drive. So they only wanted a house where she could walk to the grocery store. She had a little wagon, went to the grocery store with her wagon. The kids had to be able to walk to school. She had to be able to walk to town. And he walked to the train station."

**How to Find Properties for These Buyers:**
- Draw walking radius on map (typically 0.5 mile = comfortable walk)
- Identify properties within circle
- Verify sidewalks and safe walking routes
- Measure exact distances to key amenities
- Show buyer the map with property and destinations marked

## Listing Agreement Terms and Signatures

### Listing Type Confirmation

**Final Verification:**
- ✅ Check: **Exclusive Right to Sell** (NOT Exclusive Agency)
- Confirm correct box selected on form
- Legal terminology matters for commission protection
- Protects broker fully regardless of who sells property

### Required Documents Checklist

#### 1. Attorney General's Memorandum

**REQUIRED Before Taking Listing:**
Cannot legally take listing without reviewing fair housing requirements with seller.

**Discriminatory Request Example:**
Seller says: "I don't want any [protected class] in this neighborhood."

**Proper Agent Response:**

**Instructor's Script:**
> "I would first advise them: 'Look, it's against the law. I can only take this listing if you agree that we cannot be prejudiced.' I try that. If they say no, 'Well gee, I'm very sorry, I can't take the listing.'"

**Process:**
1. Educate seller on fair housing law
2. Explain legal requirements and penalties
3. Give seller opportunity to comply
4. If seller refuses, decline listing
5. Document refusal (protect yourself legally)

**Protected Classes:**
- Race
- Color
- National origin
- Religion
- Sex
- Familial status
- Disability
- Additional state/local protections

#### 2. Key Box Authorization

**3 Keys Required:**

**Standard Practice:**
> "One for key box, one for office, one for me."

1. **Key Box (Lockbox):**
   - Electronic lockbox mounted on property
   - Allows showing agents access
   - Tracks who accessed and when
   - Security through licensed agent access only

2. **Office:**
   - Backup key kept at brokerage office
   - Emergency access if needed
   - Key box malfunction backup
   - Allows office agents to show

3. **Agent:**
   - Listing agent's personal key
   - Quick access for showings you conduct
   - Allows you to check property
   - Facilitates open houses

**Authorization:**
Seller must sign authorization for key box installation and use.

#### 3. Lead-Based Paint Disclosure

**Upload Requirement:**

**Instructor's Update:**
> "Randy just said this now has to be uploaded into associated documents."

**New Requirement:**
- Must be uploaded to MLS within 24 hours of listing
- Part of listing package documentation
- Required for all homes built before 1978

**Seller Disclosure:**
> "Most of the time the seller says 'I don't know' and that's just fine."

**Three Options for Seller:**
- Known lead paint present
- No knowledge of lead paint
- Unknown (most common for older homes)

**Signature Requirements:**
- Seller signs at listing appointment
- Buyer must sign at contract (before attorney review)
- Agent acknowledges disclosure provided

#### 4. Informed Consent to Dual Agency

**When to Sign:**
Sign at listing appointment along with listing agreement.

**Purpose:**
- Authorizes dual agency if opportunity arises
- Protects ability for other office agents to sell property
- Required for intra-office transactions
- Prevents blocking deals with your own office

**Critical for Office Success:**
Without this authorization, no other agent in your office can bring a buyer to your listing without creating conflict.

#### 5. Consumer Information Statement (CIS)

**What It Is:**
> "The Consumer Information Statement on New Jersey real estate relationships."

**Requirement:**
All agents should read and understand CIS thoroughly.

**Topics Covered:**
- Types of agency relationships
- Agent duties to clients
- Dual agency explanation
- Transaction broker role
- Consumer rights and protections

**Use in Practice:**
- Provide to all clients (buyers and sellers)
- Review at initial consultation
- Ensure client understands representation options
- Sign acknowledgment of receipt

#### 6. Seller's Property Condition Disclosure

**Critical Legal Requirement:**

**What You CANNOT Do:**
> "CANNOT sit with them while filling out" (legally prohibited in New Jersey)

**What You CAN Do:**
> "CAN provide guidance on how to complete"

**Proper Seller Guidance:**

**Instructor's Critical Advice:**
> "Let's don't guess, don't lie, don't guess. If you don't know, just say 'I don't know.' There's a line for unknown."

**Why This Matters Legally:**
> "This document can cause you to have a lawsuit if you don't do it honestly."

**Common Unknown Items:**

**Realistic Example:**
> "I could walk into 10 houses in Ridgewood, probably 8 of them if I asked the wife 'What is the age of your furnace?' they don't know."

**Items Sellers Often Don't Know:**
- Age of furnace/boiler
- Electrical system amperage
- Hot water heater age
- Average utility costs
- Roof installation date
- HVAC maintenance history
- Well depth (if applicable)
- Septic tank capacity

**How to Help Without Completing:**

**Finding Equipment Dates:**
- Furnace/boiler: Date usually on unit label
- Hot water tank: Manufacturing date on label (may differ from install date)
- Electrical panel: Inspection sticker sometimes shows date
- HVAC: Service stickers may indicate age

**If Information Not Available:**
Write **"Unknown"** — Never guess or estimate

**Timeline Change:**

**Old Rule:**
> "Could be filled out at leisure, only needed when buyer found"

**NEW LAW:**
> "Must be uploaded with listing to MLS. Becoming legal requirement to submit immediately."

**Pre-Listing Strategy:**

**Instructor's Recommendation:**
> "Leave that with them. It could be in your first consultation when you first go through the house. Say 'Here's a document that whether you list with me is generic, it goes for every company. Whether you list with me or somebody else, this is going to have to be filled out. Now it's a law that it has to be filled in immediately.'"

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- Seller educates themselves on required information
- Reduces time at listing appointment (not filling out form together)
- Shows professionalism and regulatory knowledge
- Sets expectations early
- Gives seller time to research answers

**Items Requiring Research:**
Encourage seller to:
- Locate equipment for age verification
- Review past utility bills for average costs
- Check with prior owner if recently purchased
- Contact service companies for equipment history

## Completing Forms Efficiently

### Pre-Fill Strategy

**Time-Saving Best Practice:**

**Instructor's Method:**
> "I fill it all out before I get there because you don't want to be sitting writing things. Otherwise it'll take you three hours."

**Pre-Listing Research:**
1. MLS property search (tax info, lot size, assessment)
2. Realist research (enhanced property details)
3. Google property address (additional information)
4. Review comparable sales in neighborhood
5. Prepare pricing analysis

**Zip Forms Pre-Fill:**
1. Open Residential Listing Agreement in Zip Forms
2. Input all property information from research
3. Enter property details, taxes, lot info, schools
4. Pre-fill broker and agent information (auto-populates)
5. Enter anticipated list price and commission
6. Mark "Seller's Agent and Disclosed Dual Agent"
7. Set listing date and expiration date (6 months)

**What to Leave for Appointment:**
- Items included/excluded (walk through with seller)
- Showing instructions (discuss seller's preferences)
- Possession date (verify seller's timeline)
- Municipal assessments (confirm with seller)
- Any seller-specific information

### Wet Signatures vs. Electronic

**Wet Signatures (Physical) - PREFERRED:**

**Process:**
1. Pre-fill form on Zip Forms
2. Email to seller for review (optional)
3. Print and bring to appointment
4. **Wet sign** (physical signature) at appointment
5. More professional presentation than electronic only

**Benefits:**
- Personal, professional interaction
- Opportunity to explain each section
- Seller feels more engaged in process
- Creates formal, important document atmosphere
- Easier to review and discuss in person

**Electronic Signatures (Alternative):**

**Process:**
1. Complete entirely on Zip Forms
2. Send electronically via DocuSign or similar
3. Seller signs remotely
4. Faster but less personal

**When to Use:**
- Seller unavailable for in-person meeting
- Out-of-state or remote sellers
- Time-sensitive listing situations
- Seller preference for digital

**Best Practice:**
Offer both options, recommend wet signatures for professionalism, but accommodate seller preference.

### Submission to Management

**Office Requirements:**

**Varies by Brokerage:**
> "Marketing department reviews listing. Manager reviews listing compliance. Sometimes requires copy of listing agreement, sometimes just digital submission. Depends on office protocol."

**Typical Review Process:**
1. Agent completes listing agreement
2. Submit to manager for review
3. Manager checks:
   - All required fields completed
   - Proper agency designation
   - Commission structure correct
   - Compliance with brokerage standards
   - Required disclosures attached
4. Marketing department notified
5. Photos and marketing materials coordinated

**Christie's Protocol:**
- Marketing department involvement in listing launch
- Manager oversight of listing compliance
- Coordination between agent, manager, and marketing
- Ensures professional standards maintained

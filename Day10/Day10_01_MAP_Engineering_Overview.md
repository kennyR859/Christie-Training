## Revolutionary Changes Under New Ownership

### Timeline: Last 10 Months

MAP Engineering underwent ownership change approximately 10 months before this presentation, resulting in dramatic process improvements.

### Before New Ownership (Old System)

**Process Problems:**

1. **Slow Proposal Delivery:**
   - Printed proposals mailed to homeowners
   - Waited for physical checks to arrive
   - Lost weeks in back-and-forth communication

2. **Homeowner Burden:**
   - Homeowner received design printouts
   - Homeowner given instructions on health department location and hours
   - Homeowner responsible for hand-delivery to health department
   - Homeowner navigated health department schedules:
     - Long lunch breaks
     - Closed for every holiday
     - Limited office hours
   - Homeowner followed up for approvals

3. **Poor Communication:**
   - Engineers hard to reach (drawing, in field, at test sites)
   - No dedicated project managers
   - Delayed responses to questions
   - Agent and homeowner frustration

4. **Timeline Issues:**
   - One client testimonial: **"You could give birth 3 times before things could move forward"**
   - Excessive delays at every stage
   - No accountability or tracking

### After New Ownership (Current System)

**Transformative Improvements:**

1. **Technology Integration:**
   - **Online quote system** (10-minute turnaround)
   - **Automated payment processing** (credit card and ACH)
   - **Email notification system** (real-time updates)
   - **Database of 250+ towns** (instant fee calculation)

2. **Concierge Service:**
   - **MAP hand-delivers to health departments** (no homeowner involvement)
   - **MAP expedites approvals** (professional relationships)
   - **MAP schedules all appointments** (soil tests, inspections)
   - **MAP coordinates all parties** (homeowner, town, contractors)

3. **Enhanced Communication:**
   - **Dedicated project managers:** Craig, Sherry, Dan
   - **Direct phone and email access**
   - **Same-day response commitment**
   - **In-office availability** to interrupt engineers when urgent
   - **Agent kept in loop** at every stage via email

4. **Accelerated Timeline:**
   - **Quote:** 10 minutes after online form submission
   - **Soil test scheduled:** Within 5 days of payment
   - **Design completed:** 2 business days after soil log
   - **Overall process:** 10-12 weeks (best case) vs. "giving birth 3 times"

> "We take a lot of weight off your shoulders. No longer do you have to run around doing any of the things you used to do. It's a lot of work coordinating the client, the house, the town, and the person digging the hole—they're all scheduled at different times. We take care of all that instead of you worrying about making all those calls."
> — Craig, MAP Engineering

## Winter Research Initiative

### Dan and Sherry's Database Project

**Objective:** Create comprehensive, instant quote system

**Two-Pronged Approach:**

1. **Installer Interviews:**
   - Contacted and interviewed septic installation contractors
   - Gathered pricing information
   - Assessed availability and capabilities
   - Built contractor network database

2. **Health Department Research:**
   - Called every health department in coverage area
   - Documented fee structures
   - Learned approval processes and timelines
   - Identified contact persons and requirements

**Result:**
- **250+ towns and properties** in database
- Instant quote generation (5 components included)
- Accurate fee calculations
- Realistic timeline expectations

**Quote Components Generated:**
1. Engineering fee (MAP's design services)
2. Soil log fee (excavation contractor)
3. Perc test fee (if needed)
4. Health department fees (town/county permits)
5. Survey with topography (if needed)

## Online Platform - Homeowner Portal

### Website Form Submission

**Location:** MAP Engineering website → Homeowners section

**Form Design:**
- "Very intuitive form field" created by Dan and Sherry
- Captures all necessary information for quote
- Triggers automated quote generation

### Who Should Fill Out the Form?

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Agent fills it out WITH client** (best option)
   - Opportunity to understand client concerns
   - Build relationship during process
   - Ensure accuracy of information
   - Agent email captured for updates

2. **MAP fills it out with client** (if agent unavailable)
   - Phone consultation with MAP staff
   - Same benefits as agent involvement

3. **Client fills it out alone** (NOT recommended unless very savvy)
   - Risk of incomplete or inaccurate information
   - Missed opportunity for relationship building
   - Agent not in loop for updates

**Critical Form Field:**
> "The most important thing for you is that you fill out the last four or five fields—they're all about you as the agent. Do that so that as we move forward through the system, you will get updates if anything happens. This is about facilitating closing this deal and finding your next listing."
> — Craig, MAP Engineering

**Agent Information Required:**
- Agent name
- Agent email (for automated updates)
- Agent phone
- Brokerage information

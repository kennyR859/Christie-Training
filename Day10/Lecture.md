- Waiting for checks to arrive (losing weeks)
- Homeowner had to hand-deliver documents to health departments
- Poor communication and responsiveness
- One client said: "You could give birth 3 times before things could move forward"

**After (Current System):**
- **Automated online platform** for quotes and payments
- **5-day turnaround** for soil test scheduling (from receipt of payment)
- **2 business days** for design completion after soil log
- **Hand-delivery service** to health departments by MAP Engineering
- **Direct project manager** communication (Craig, Sherry, Dan available)
- **Real-time updates** to agents via email throughout process

> "We take a lot of weight off your shoulders. No longer do you have to run around doing any of the things you used to do. It's a lot of work coordinating the client, the house, the town, and the person digging the hole—they're all scheduled at different times. We take care of all that instead of you worrying about making all those calls."
> — Craig, MAP Engineering

## Survey Requirements

### Survey Age and Validity

**10-Year Rule (General Guideline):**
- Surveys under 10 years old MAY be acceptable if no changes to property
- Engineers must review survey before confirming usability
- Comparison with Google Earth and town property records

**Survey Must Be Rejected If:**
- Additions to home have been built
- New decks, fences, or structures added
- Trees planted or removed
- Any ground disturbance or changes
- Survey is 30-40+ years old (common issue)

**Sealed Survey Requirement:**
- Health departments require **sealed surveys** in most cases
- PDF copies often not acceptable without seal
- If original surveyor still in business, they can re-seal old survey (saves money)

### Topography Requirement

**Critical for Engineering:**
- 99% of homeowners do not have topography on existing survey
- **Essential** for MAP engineers to calculate septic system design
- Required for properties 2+ acres (very expensive if starting from scratch)
- MAP includes topography in quote

**Cost Savings:**
- If usable survey exists: Saves ~$1,000
- If new survey needed (under 1 acre): ~$1,600
- Time savings: 1 to 1.5 weeks if existing survey can be used

> "Many cases depend on what's changed on the property. If the homeowner has had an addition, new deck, trees planted or taken down, fence, pool—absolutely we need a new survey. We've seen surveys go back 40-50 years."
> — Sherry, MAP Engineering

### Survey Review Process

**How It Works:**
1. Real estate agent or homeowner emails existing survey to MAP
2. MAP forwards to engineer via email
3. Engineer reviews within **1-2 hours**
4. Engineer compares with:
   - Town property records
   - Google Earth satellite images
   - Online databases
5. Approval or new survey requirement communicated

## Septic Inspection Process

### Septic Inspection vs Home Inspection

**Key Distinction:**
- **Home inspection companies** ≠ **Septic inspection companies**
- Separate specialized companies perform septic inspections
- Reports can be "cryptic" with unfamiliar terminology

### Complimentary Report Review Service

**MAP Engineering Offers:**
- **Free review** of any septic inspection report
- Engineers interpret technical language
- Determine if **repair** vs **new installation** needed

**9 out of 10 times:**
- If it's a **repair**, you do NOT need an engineer
- MAP can refer you to septic company for repair work

**If new installation/alteration needed:**
- "Septic alteration" = **whole new system**
- Engineer required for design and approval
- MAP proceeds with full process

### Proactive Inspection Strategy

**Scenario:** Seller has 25-30 year old septic system

**Reactive Approach (Risky):**
- Wait for buyer's septic inspection
- Get surprised with failure report during contract
- Time pressure to resolve
- Seller shocked by sudden expense

**Proactive Approach (Recommended):**
- Seller gets own septic inspection BEFORE listing
- Know what you're walking into
- Prepare seller mentally and financially
- Have TWO reports to compare (seller's + buyer's)
- Get ahead of problems

> "Sometimes the reports are drastically different. It's better to get ahead of it so you know what you're looking at and it prepares them mentally. When you're under contract and you're hit with a failing system all of a sudden, it's a shock to the system."
> — Sherry, MAP Engineering

**Agent Strategy:**
- You can be "the good guy" by having MAP review report
- Let MAP be "the bad guy" if bad news is delivered
- Send report to MAP engineers for complete rundown

---

## Soil Log and System Design

### Soil Log Test Procedure

**What Is a Soil Log?**
- Excavating contractor digs test holes on property
- Determines what type of system needs to be designed
- Soil samples taken back to MAP Engineering lab

**Coordination Required:**
- Health department representative
- MAP engineers
- Real estate agent OR homeowner
- Excavating contractor (installer)

**Location Factors Considered:**
- Existing wells on property
- Other nearby septic systems
- Property boundaries and setbacks
- Water sources close to property (streams, ponds, wetlands)
- Soil type and composition

**MAP Engineering Lab Analysis:**
- Soil samples tested in on-site lab
- Quality assessment
- Determines soil percolation characteristics
- Informs system type and design specifications

### Design Process

**Timeline:**
- **2 business days** to complete design after soil log
- "Our engineers work very quickly—they're usually able to pump out these designs within two business days, which is really amazing."

**Design Considerations:**
- Property size (acreage)
- Number of bedrooms (5-bedroom system capacity example)
- Soil test results
- Proximity to water sources
- Health department requirements
- Town-specific regulations

**Design Review:**
- Homeowner can request to see design before health department submission
- Ensures they're comfortable with system placement
- MAP explains design choices if questions arise

---

## Health Department Approval Process

### Submission Process (MAP Handles Everything)

**Old System (Before New Ownership):**
- Print design and mail to homeowner
- Homeowner receives instructions on where to go
- Homeowner navigates health department schedule:
  - Long lunch breaks
  - Closed for every holiday
  - Limited office hours
- Homeowner hand-delivers all documents
- Homeowner follows up on approval

**New System (Current - MAP Handles):**
- MAP hand-delivers everything to health department
- MAP expedites and simplifies process
- Agent and homeowner kept in loop every step
- MAP follows up for approval

### Timeline Variations by Town

**Fast Towns:**
- Standard turnaround: 1-2 weeks
- Efficient health departments with clear processes

**Slow Towns:**
- **Jefferson:** "Takes them about 94 years to send an approval" (hyperbole, but notoriously slow)
- Some towns: 4-6 weeks for approval
- Variables outside MAP's control

**Example Town Requirements:**
- Wyckoff: Strict standards, Mark (inspector) fails systems frequently
- Wayne: Won't allow simple repairs, requires full engineering assessment
- Each town has unique interpretation of regulations

### Approval Factors

**What Health Departments Review:**
- Engineering calculations
- Soil test results
- System design specifications
- Setback requirements from wells, property lines, water sources
- Bedroom count vs system capacity
- Compliance with state and local codes

- **50 years possible** with excellent maintenance (example: engineer's mother-in-law)

**Variables Affecting Lifespan:**
- **Usage intensity**
  - Number of occupants
  - Laundry frequency ("35 loads a day" will kill system)
  - Guest usage (parties, large gatherings)
- **What goes down drains**
  - Flushing inappropriate items
  - Harsh chemicals
  - Grease and oils
  - Sanitary products
- **Maintenance frequency**
  - Regular pumping schedule
  - Filter cleaning (ATU systems)
  - Professional inspections

### Critical Need: Do's and Don'ts Education

**Agent Request During Webinar:**
> "Would you provide us with a list of do's and don'ts on how to care for a septic? Most buyers don't understand and have never lived in a home with a septic system. It's really important for us to give them education."
> — Diane, Real Estate Agent

**MAP's Response:**
- Agreed to create branded educational materials
- Will include company contact information
- Agents can distribute to clients
- Especially critical for **first-time homebuyers**

### Septic System Do's and Don'ts

**DON'TS (Critical Rules):**

1. **Do NOT trust "septic safe" labels**
   - "Any product that says septic safe should NOT be used in septic system" — MAP Engineers
   - Includes wipes marketed as "flushable" and "septic safe"

2. **Do NOT flush:**
   - White wipes (even if labeled flushable)
   - Tampons and sanitary products
   - Paper towels
   - Cotton swabs
   - Cigarette butts
   - Any non-toilet paper items

3. **Do NOT pour down drains:**
   - Cooking oil and grease
   - Paint and chemicals
   - Harsh cleaning products
   - Excessive amounts of any liquid

4. **Do NOT overload system:**
   - Avoid excessive laundry in single day
   - Limit large gatherings without porta-potties
   - Don't use system beyond bedroom capacity

**Example Overload Scenario:**
- Halloween party in barn with 60+ guests
- Solution: Ordered 2 porta-potties to protect septic
- Signs in bathrooms: "DO NOT FLUSH" for large gatherings

**DO'S (Maintenance Best Practices):**

1. **Pump regularly:**
   - **Every 3 years** for standard conventional systems
   - **Every 2 years** for older systems (play it safe)
   - Never wait for signs of failure

2. **ATU System Maintenance:**
   - **Advanced Treatment Unit** systems require special care
   - **Twice yearly** filter cleaning and maintenance
   - Still pump every 3 years even with regular maintenance

3. **Usage awareness:**
   - Understand system capacity (bedroom count)
   - Monitor guest usage during events
   - Spread out laundry over multiple days
   - Use water efficiently

4. **Professional education:**
   - Attend MAP Engineering webinars
   - Request inspection report explanations
   - Ask questions before problems arise

### Client Education Gaps

**Common Buyer Misconceptions:**
- "Most buyers don't understand septic systems at all"
- Many buyers come from municipal sewer areas
- They don't know maintenance requirements
- They aren't aware of usage limitations
- They don't understand financial responsibility

**Example - Newcomer Experience:**
> "I'm from Belleville, NJ. I grew up on sewer. When I got a septic, I'm like 'what is this?' It was a night and day difference. Education is everything."
> — Sherry, MAP Engineering

**Consequence of Poor Education:**
- System failures within years instead of decades
- Expensive repairs needed
- Buyer frustration and regret
- Potential liability issues for agents

## OPRA Report System

### What is OPRA?

**OPRA = Open Public Records Act**

OPRA reports provide access to public records related to septic systems and property information maintained by local municipalities and health departments.

### Purpose in Real Estate Transactions

**Why OPRA Reports Are Critical:**
- Reveals **septic system history** on file with health department
- Shows construction records and permits
- Identifies septic system capacity (bedroom count)
- Uncovers past repairs or modifications
- Provides documentation for due diligence

**When to Use OPRA:**
- Seller doesn't know septic system capacity
- No records of septic installation or replacement
- Verifying bedroom count vs septic system capacity
- Before listing property with septic system
- During buyer due diligence period

### How to Obtain OPRA Reports

**Request Process:**
1. Contact local health department
2. Request OPRA records for specific property address
3. Most towns email reports at no charge
4. Some towns charge small fee for physical copies
5. Turnaround: Usually 1-3 business days

**Information Typically Included:**
- Septic system installation permits
- Certificate of approval from health department
- System design specifications
- Bedroom capacity approval
- Any repair or modification records
- Inspection reports on file

### Critical Use Case: Bedroom Count Verification

**Problem Scenario:**
> "You're selling a house with 5 bedrooms. You need to ask if their septic is a 5-bedroom septic or is it a 3-bedroom septic, because some people just go ahead and put an addition on and they never think of it. They could finish an attic and put bedrooms up, and then you have that issue as to whether or not it's going to pass muster."

**Solution:**
- Get OPRA report to verify actual septic capacity
- Compare to current bedroom count
- Identify discrepancies before listing
- Avoid surprises during buyer inspections

**What to Do If Mismatch Found:**
- Seller added bedrooms without upgrading septic = problem
- Options:
  1. Upgrade septic system to match bedroom count
  2. Remove bedroom designation from additional rooms
  3. Disclose limitation to buyers
  4. Price accordingly

### OPRA as Due Diligence Tool

**Agent Best Practice:**
> "I get it on every house. It's really important and I think it's something that is good for you to offer your sellers that you'll go get an OPRA report for you. It doesn't cost very much at all. In fact, most towns if they email it to you they don't even charge you."

**Benefits for Agents:**
- Professional thoroughness
- Catch issues before listing
- Educate sellers on their system
- Avoid transaction delays
- Protect your commission

**Benefits for Sellers:**
- Know what they have before listing
- Prepare for buyer questions
- Budget for potential upgrades
- No surprises during contract

**Benefits for Buyers:**
- Verify septic capacity matches home
- Understand maintenance history
- Plan for future additions
- Make informed offer

### OPRA Report Interpretation

**Common Findings:**
- "3-bedroom septic approved [date]"
- Certificate of completion with capacity
- No records found (older systems pre-dating regulations)
- Repair permits showing past work
- Failed inspection records requiring follow-up

**Red Flags in OPRA Reports:**
- Bedroom count mismatch with current home
- Old system with no records (30-40+ years)
- Failed inspections never resolved
- Additions permitted but no septic upgrade
- Multiple repair attempts indicating failing system

### Integration with MAP Engineering

**How OPRA and MAP Work Together:**
1. Get OPRA report to understand existing system
2. Send OPRA report to MAP for review
3. MAP determines if capacity matches current home
4. If mismatch, MAP designs upgraded system
5. New certificate of completion updates OPRA records

**Cost-Effective Strategy:**
- Free or low-cost OPRA report
- Reveals information before spending on inspection
- Helps MAP provide accurate quote
- Avoids unnecessary expenses if system adequate

## Listing Agreement Preparation

### Types of Listing Agreements

**Exclusive Right to Sell (Standard - What We Take):**
- Broker entitled to commission regardless of who sells
- Even if seller finds buyer themselves, broker gets paid
- Industry standard, protects broker investment
- What Christie's uses exclusively

**Exclusive Agency (NOT Recommended):**
- Seller retains right to sell property themselves without commission
- Only compensate broker if broker or another agent brings buyer
- "Never click that EA" — Instructor
- Risky for brokers, avoid this type

### Residential Listing Agreement Form Structure

**Key Form Sections:**

#### Property Information
- **Property Address:** Where the property is located
- **Owner's Address:** May differ if investment property
- Listing broker ID and salesperson ID (auto-populates in Platform)

#### Agency Disclosure
**Agent Role:**
- You are the **seller's agent** (check this box)
- NOT exclusive agency
- Always select "Seller's Agent" designation

**Cooperation Type:**
- Co-op (cooperating with other brokers)
- Non-cooperating (exclusive to your office temporarily)

#### Property Details

**Bedrooms and Bathrooms:**
- Accurate count critical for septic system capacity
- Verify with OPRA report if septic system exists

**Solar Panels:**
- Owned vs Leased
- Disclose lease terms if applicable

**Style and Sub-Style:**
> "Google all the different styles of homes. It's a funny thing what style could be. When you're in the computer it'll say two-story, colonial, but then the sub-style is where it gets a little crazy."

**Style Examples:**
- Two story
- Colonial
- Ranch
- Cape Cod
- Split level
- Bi-level

**Sub-Style Examples:**
- Tudor (architectural detail, not house type)
- Contemporary
- Mediterranean
- Farmhouse
- Craftsman

**Floor Breakdown:**
- **Ground floor:** Bi-level entry level
- **1st floor:** Living room, dining room, kitchen
- **2nd floor:** Bedrooms in colonial
- **3rd floor:** Attic bedrooms in older homes (Tudor, farmhouse)
- **Basement:** Total finished vs partially finished

#### Items Included and Items Not Included

**Be Specific:**
- List appliances staying/going
- Fixtures included (chandeliers, window treatments)
- Outdoor equipment (swing sets, sheds)
- Negotiable items noted separately

**Related to Contract Line 108** (covered in Day 4 training)

#### Easements

**How to Find Easement Information:**

**Question to Seller:**
> "Do you have any easements? I don't know, I have no idea."

**Research Sources:**
1. **Survey** (shows easement locations and types)
2. **Deed** (legal easement language)
3. **Title company** (most reliable source)
4. **Town/municipality** (public easement records)

**Easement Considerations:**
- Some easements can be removed if no longer in use
- Example: Road easements that never materialized
- Title company confirms active vs inactive easements
- Survey may show old easements that are now defunct

**Corner Lot Easements:**
- Original road planned to back lot
- Road never built
- Easement remains on survey but functionally gone
- Title company validates removal

#### Taxes

**Where to Find Tax Information:**
> "Go into the computer, go into search, and just look up the address of the property into your New Jersey MLS or whatever MLS and then look up the taxes on that house."

**Tax Information Available in MLS:**
- Current tax amount
- Assessment value
- Square footage of property (land)
- Square footage of building
- Lot dimensions
- Tax breakdown by category

**Alternative Research Tool:**
- **Realist platform** (more detailed property information)
- Sometimes includes survey information
- School district information
- Tax assessment history

#### Lot Information

**Lot Square Footage:**
- Usually available in tax records
- MLS property search shows this information
- Can calculate: 1/4 acre, 1/2 acre, etc.

**Frontage:**
> "Let's say this is the diagram of a lot and the house is right here, this is the street, this is the frontage. It's the length from here to here."

**Frontage Definition:**
- The property line facing the street where the address is located
- Measured in linear feet along the street
- Critical for setback requirements and zoning

**Corner Lot Frontage:**
- Two possible frontages (two streets)
- **Frontage is always where the address is**
- If address is 119 West Saddle River Road → frontage is on West Saddle River Road
- Not necessarily the side where the front door is located

**Finding Frontage Information:**
- Survey (most accurate)
- Tax records (rarely includes frontage)
- MLS (use seller's name if address unclear)
- Realist platform (sometimes available)

#### Schools

**Important Considerations:**
> "The schools can change. In Ridgewood for instance, this year you have probably 25 new kids going to Ridge School and next year there's 50, so they may divide a street off and put it to Orchard or something. They can move it all around."

**Agent Response:**
- Provide current school assignments
- Advise: "These are what is now, it's possible it could change"
- Direct buyers: "Speak with the principal"
- **DO NOT guarantee school assignments**

**Fair Housing Compliance:**
- Never say "This school is better than that school"
- Provide factual information only (public data)
- Direct to school websites and parent contacts
- After buyer mentions children, can discuss age-appropriate programs

**Research Tools:**
- Realist platform
- School district websites
- Tax records (sometimes)
- May not be on tax records, verify with district

#### Municipal Assessments

**What Are Municipal Assessments?**
- Special charges for local improvements
- Sidewalk installation or repair
- Road paving assessments
- Sewer connection fees
- Other infrastructure improvements

**How to Handle on Listing Form:**
> "I probably would leave that blank until I find out for sure, until I was absolutely sure. The seller might know that they—you can ask them: have you had anything like a new sidewalk? They might get assessed for that."

**Seller Knowledge:**
- Ask directly about recent municipal work
- Check tax bills for assessment line items
- Verify with town if uncertain
- Include in disclosure if known

#### Listing Date and Expiration Date

**Listing Date:**
- Date listing agreement is signed
- **MLS requires upload within 24 hours** of listing date

**Why We DON'T Put Listings in MLS Immediately:**
> "We don't want to put our listings in 24 hours because who would have any pictures right? We wouldn't have a brochure, we wouldn't have any social media lined up, we wouldn't have anything done."

**Solution: Exclusive Listing Period:**
- Take listing as "Exclusive Listing Agreement"
- Non-cooperating status initially
- Gives time to:
  - Order professional photos
  - Create marketing materials
  - Set up social media campaigns
  - Send "Just Listed" cards
  - Prepare brochures
  - Boost open house marketing

**Duration of Exclusive Period:**
- **10 days** if just marketing prep needed
- **1 month** if seller needs to paint/repair
- Use "Change of Status" form to launch when ready

**Expiration Date:**
- Standard: 6 months from signing
- Exclusive period ≠ expiration date
- Expiration protects broker rights long-term

### Exclusive Listing Strategy

**Why Sign Now, Launch Later:**

**Scenario:**
> "I'd like to list with you but I want to paint the living room before I put it on. Could you come back in a month and we'll list it?"

**WRONG Response:**
"Okay, I'll come back in a month."

**RIGHT Response:**
> "That's great! That's perfect because that gives me time to prepare all the marketing I need to prepare before we truly launch it. Let's sign it now, gives you time to do what you want to do and me time to get my thing together. I can put it in the multiple as an exclusive without anybody seeing it, but I can't start my marketing and my photos and everything I need to do unless we sign this document."

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- Protects agent from seller going to someone else
- Locks in listing before neighbor brings buyer
- Allows professional marketing preparation
- Gives seller time for improvements
- Everyone wins

**What Can Happen If You Wait:**
- Neighbor comes with friend who wants property
- Seller lists with different agent
- Your preparation work means nothing
- Lost opportunity

### Change of Status Form

**Purpose:**
- Transition from office exclusive to full MLS listing
- Schedule launch date in advance
- Automated activation on specified date

**How It Works:**
1. Take listing on November 18th as office exclusive
2. Fill out Change of Status form
3. Set launch date: January 5th (or whenever ready)
4. Upload professional photos
5. Organize photos in logical order
6. Complete all marketing materials
7. Form automatically changes status on launch date

**Photo Organization Best Practices:**
> "You want to organize them as if you're walking through the house. Entry foyer, living room, dining room, family room, kitchen. You want it all to flow nicely as if somebody's really walking through the home."

**Photos to Avoid:**
- Bathrooms so small the picture is just a toilet
- Unflattering angles
- Cluttered spaces without staging
- Dark rooms with poor lighting

### Broker Fee and Compensation

**How to Present Commission:**
> "This is what I do: I always put it in there already. I just stick it in there. Whatever you're asking, don't ask them, put it in."

**Standard Approach:**
- Pre-fill commission percentage (typically 6%)
- Present as standard business practice
- Don't ask permission, state professionally

**Commission Language:**
> "The broker agrees to pay the broker a compensation of 6%. If the compensation is a percentage, it shall be a percentage of the offering price or any other sales price accepted by the seller."

**When Commission is Earned:**
- Property sold by seller directly
- Property sold by listing broker
- Property sold through any other source
- **During the term of the exclusive right to sell**

**Protection Clause Example:**
> "Some wise guy goes and knocks on the door, doesn't call the broker, then the seller calls up and says 'Hey I got somebody here, they want to buy it. Do I have to pay you a commission because I kind of got them myself?' Yeah, you do. That's what that paragraph protects you."

### Agency Disclosure

**Agent Role Selection:**
- **Seller's agent only** (limited, less common)
- **Transaction broker** (neutral facilitator)
- **Seller's agent and disclosed dual agent if opportunity arises** (BEST CHOICE)

**Why Disclosed Dual Agent Option is Critical:**
> "If you don't do that, nobody else at Christie's can sell it. Has to be Seller's agent and disclosed dual agent."

**Dual Agency Scenario:**
- Another Christie's agent has buyer for your listing
- With proper disclosure, transaction can proceed
- Without dual agency authorization, deal blocked
- Disclosed = all parties informed and consent

### Tail Provision (Post-Expiration Protection)

**Standard Language:**
> "In the event that the property or any part of it described in this agreement becomes subject to a written or other agreement and is transferred within [X] days after the expiration of this agreement to anyone..."

**What This Means:**
- Listing expires
- Buyer who saw property during listing term purchases after expiration
- Broker still entitled to commission
- Showing broker also entitled to commission

**Typical Duration:**
- Most brokers: **190 days** after expiration
- Can negotiate: **365 days** if desired
- Protects broker investment in marketing

**Important Limitation:**
> "Somebody who saw it during the term of your listing, whether it was with you or another broker. If you want to pursue this, you do have to keep some records."

**When Tail Provision Does NOT Apply:**
- Buyer who never saw property during listing term
- Seller re-lists with another broker immediately after expiration
- "All bets are off, doesn't mean anything on the listing side"

**Record Keeping for Tail Protection:**
- Keep showing appointment records
- Document all showings with dates
- Save showing feedback
- Email confirmations of tours
- Protects your claim if dispute arises

### Possession Date

**Computer Default Options:**
- 1 to 30 days
- 30 to 60 days
- 60 to 90 days
- 90 to 120 days

**Specific Date Requirements:**
> "You might have to under 'additional contractual provisions' if they really have a specific date which is unusual. 'We have to be out of here, we bought a house already, we have to be out of here by whatever date.'"

**Agent Caution:**
> "I would never tell the world that because it makes it look like they're desperate to sell. But I could try to say 'seller would prefer to have their children registered in a new school by whatever.' You could do that if you want, but or you could just let it default to a date."

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- Use default ranges when possible
- Avoid revealing seller urgency
- Frame specific dates around practical needs (school, job relocation)
- Protect seller's negotiating position

### Showing Instructions and Agent Remarks

**Showing Instructions (Not Public):**
- This line is **NOT for public viewing**
- Never send full report to buyers (computer won't allow it anyway)
- Internal broker-to-broker communication only

**What Goes in Showing Instructions:**
- **Showing Time system:** Click blue link to schedule
- "Call listing broker"
- "Text listing broker [phone]"
- "No showings between [baby's nap time]"
- "No showings after 8 PM"
- Religious restrictions (Friday night to Saturday night)
- Key location (if not using lockbox)
- Special access instructions

**Showing Time System:**
> "You click on Showing Time and you can play with it, just don't really schedule a showing. You click on Showing Time and you put your request in for the time you want. It will come up with Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and from 9:00 in the morning till whatever time at night, and it'll have little black things on it if it's not available where they block it out."

**Showing Time Best Practices:**
- Put your name and contact info
- **NEVER put buyer's name** in showing request
- Exception: If buyer signed agreement and you need tracking
- Alternative tracking: Email/text buyer after showing for documentation

**Customer Remarks (Public Marketing):**
- Use ChatGPT for property description
- Review other listings for formatting ideas
- Describe home features professionally

**Example Structure:**
> "This lovely four bedroom colonial sits on a private expansive lot..."

**Prohibited Keywords (Fair Housing):**
- ❌ "Master bedroom" → ✅ "Primary bedroom"
- ❌ "Walk to town" → ✅ "Close proximity to town/shopping"
- ✅ CAN use: "Two blocks from downtown"
- ✅ CAN use: "Quarter mile to train station"
- ✅ CAN use: "1/16th of a mile to shopping"

**Measurement Alternatives:**
- Google Maps for exact distances
- Specify blocks, miles, or fractions
- "Close proximity to schools/trains"
- Avoid vague "walk to" language

**Special Buyer Needs Example:**
> "I had one customer, the wife absolutely refused to drive. She did not want to drive. So they only wanted a house where she could walk to the grocery store. She had a little wagon, went to the grocery store with her wagon. The kids had to be able to walk to school. She had to be able to walk to town. And he walked to the train station."

**Research Tools for Walkability:**
- Google Maps (measure distances)
- Turf/Platform (mapping features)
- Draw circles around property for radius search
- Find homes within walking distance to amenities

### Listing Agreement Terms and Signatures

**Listing Type Confirmation:**
- Check: **Exclusive Right to Sell** (not Exclusive Agency)
- Legal terminology matters
- Protects broker fully

**Required Documents:**

**1. Attorney General's Memorandum:**
- **REQUIRED** before taking listing
- Cannot take listing if seller expresses discriminatory preferences
- Example: "I don't want any [protected class] in this neighborhood"

**Agent Response to Discrimination:**
> "I would first advise them: 'Look, it's against the law. I can only take this listing if you agree that we cannot be prejudiced.' I try that. If they say no, 'Well gee, I'm very sorry, I can't take the listing.'"

**2. Key Box Authorization:**
- **3 keys required:**
  1. **Key box** (electronic lockbox for showings)
  2. **Office** (backup for office access)
  3. **Agent** (personal key for listing agent)

**3. Lead-Based Paint Disclosure:**
> "Randy just said this now has to be uploaded into associated documents. Most of the time the seller says 'I don't know' and that's just fine."

**Upload Requirement:**
- Must be uploaded to MLS within 24 hours
- Seller can check "Unknown" if unsure
- Buyer must sign at contract
- Seller must sign at listing

**4. Informed Consent to Dual Agency:**
- Sign at listing appointment
- Authorizes dual agency if opportunity arises
- Protects ability for other office agents to sell

**5. Consumer Information Statement (CIS):**
> "This would be something good for you guys to really read: the Consumer Information Statement on New Jersey real estate relationships. Read it."

**6. Seller's Property Condition Disclosure:**
- **CANNOT sit with them while filling out** (legally)
- **CAN provide guidance on how to complete**

**Critical Seller Guidance:**
> "Let's don't guess, don't lie, don't guess. If you don't know, just say 'I don't know.' There's a line for unknown."

**Why This Matters:**
> "This document can cause you to have a lawsuit if you don't do it honestly. If you really don't know—I could walk into 10 houses in Ridgewood, probably 8 of them if I asked the wife 'What is the age of your furnace?' they don't know."

**Common Unknown Items:**
- Age of furnace/boiler
- Type of electrical system (amps)
- Hot water heater age
- Average utility costs
- Roof age
- HVAC service history

**How to Help Without Guessing:**
- Date usually on furnace/boiler
- Hot water tank has manufacture date (may differ from install)
- Utility companies provide usage history
- If unknown, write "Unknown" — do NOT guess

**Timeline for Property Disclosure:**
- **Old rule:** Could be filled out at leisure, only needed when buyer found
- **NEW LAW:** Must be uploaded with listing to MLS
- Becoming legal requirement to submit immediately

**Pre-Listing Strategy:**
> "Leave that with them. It could be in your first consultation when you first go through the house. Say 'Here's a document that whether you list with me is generic, it goes for every company. Whether you list with me or somebody else, this is going to have to be filled out. Now it's a law that it has to be filled in immediately.'"

**Benefits:**
- Client educates themselves on what's needed
- Reduces listing appointment time
- Shows professionalism
- Sets expectations early

### Completing Forms Efficiently

**Pre-Fill Everything:**
> "I fill it all out before I get there because you don't want to be sitting writing things. Otherwise it'll take you three hours."

**Wet Signatures Preferred:**
- Fill out forms on Zip Forms
- Email to seller for review (optional)
- Print and bring to appointment
- **Wet sign** (physical signature) at appointment
- More professional than electronic only

**Alternative:**
- Complete entirely on Zip Forms
- Send electronically for e-signature
- Faster but less personal

**Submission to Management:**
- Marketing department reviews listing
- Manager reviews listing compliance
- Sometimes requires copy of listing agreement
- Sometimes just digital submission
- Depends on office protocol

## Procuring Cause and Commission Disputes

### What is Procuring Cause?

**Definition:**
Procuring cause determines which agent is entitled to commission when multiple agents claim involvement in a transaction.

### Evolution of Procuring Cause

**Old Understanding (Outdated):**
> "People still think it is the right of the original showing broker. Nowhere. That is a very small part of it now."

**Modern Definition:**
Procuring cause now encompasses:
- Original showing (minor factor)
- Quality of information provided
- Ongoing communication and follow-up
- Market knowledge demonstrated
- Ability to assist and help buyer purchase
- Documentation of service

### Scenarios Leading to Disputes

**Example 1: Ghost Clients**
- Agent shows property
- Agent has buyer's agreement signed
- Buyer ghosts the agent (stops communicating)
- Agent never follows up
- Buyer purchases through sister-in-law (also an agent)

**Outcome:**
- Original agent **might still get commission**
- **IF properly documented:**
  - Kept buyer informed of listing changes
  - Sent price reduction notifications
  - Provided market updates
  - Showed continued service attempt

**Example 2: Unethical Buyer Behavior**
- Buyer signs agreement with Agent A
- Buyer really wants to work with sister-in-law (new licensee)
- Uses Agent A just to see properties
- Sister-in-law was "too busy" to show
- Buyer terminates agreement with Agent A
- Buyer signs agreement with sister-in-law

**Outcome:**
- Original Agent A **might get whole commission**
- Pattern of unethical behavior is obvious
- Would go to arbitration
- Documentation critical

### How to Protect Your Commission

**Documentation Requirements:**

**1. Buyer's Agreement:**
- Signed buyer's agreement is foundation
- Shows legal relationship existed
- Proves you were representing buyer

**2. Communication Records:**
> "In order for me to get the commission, I would have had to keep in touch with them, keep them abreast of any changes that happen to that listing."

**Must Document:**
- Price reductions emailed to buyer
- Market changes communicated
- Interest rate updates shared
- Property status changes forwarded
- Showing follow-ups

**3. Service Documentation:**
- Emails sent about properties
- Text messages discussing showings
- Market analysis provided
- Financing assistance offered
- School research conducted

**Example Protection Email:**
> "After you've left the home and you showed it to them and you just kind of don't trust them, you would send an email to them or text them and say 'Just wondered how you felt about the house at 123 Main Street' and just leave it. Then you have that."

**4. Knowledge and Expertise:**
- School information provided
- Mortgage programs recommended
- Special programs identified (affordable housing)
- Neighborhood expertise demonstrated
- Bus line locations
- Soccer teams, special ed programs

**Example:**
> "You convinced them that that school system was proper for them. A million different things could go in, but it's all about your ability to service them properly and give them the right information that they need."

### Arbitration Process

**When It Goes to Arbitration:**
- Both agents claim commission entitlement
- Can't reach agreement through negotiation
- Dispute filed with real estate board

**How It Works:**
1. **Write up your case** with documentation
2. **Submit to arbitration panel**
3. **Panel composition:** Group of peer agents similar to you
4. **Volunteers** serve on panel
5. **Review evidence** from both parties
6. **Decision rendered** based on service and documentation

**Outcome Possibilities:**
- 100% to one agent
- Split commission (e.g., 60/40, 70/30)
- Based on level of service documented
- Usually "pretty fair" according to instructors

### Reduced Disputes with Buyer Agreements

**Modern Reality:**
> "It's not going to happen as much anymore because of the buyer agreement, the buyer broker agreement."

**Why Buyer Agreements Help:**
- Legal relationship established
- Terms clearly defined
- Commission arrangements documented
- Harder for buyers to circumvent

**BUT Still Possible:**
> "Keep in mind that those agreements can be terminated at any time."

**Termination Scenario:**
- Buyer signs agreement with Agent A
- Buyer uses Agent A to show properties
- Buyer really wants to work with sister-in-law
- Buyer terminates agreement with Agent A
- Buyer signs with sister-in-law
- Transaction proceeds with sister-in-law

**If Pattern is Obvious:**
- Original agent may still prevail
- Documentation of service is key
- Arbitration panel sees through schemes
- Original agent protected if properly documented

### Best Practices to Avoid Disputes

**1. Always Get Buyer Agreement Signed:**
- Before showing any properties
- Clearly explain terms

# Day 10 - Topic 02: Survey Requirements & Topography

## Overview

Surveys with topography are essential for septic system engineering, but they represent a significant cost and timeline variable in the septic replacement process. Understanding survey requirements, when existing surveys can be used, and how to save clients time and money is critical knowledge for real estate agents handling septic transactions.

## The 10-Year Rule (General Guideline)

### Survey Age Parameters

**General Standard:**
- Surveys **under 10 years old** MAY be acceptable
- Subject to engineer review and approval
- Must meet specific conditions (see below)

**Critical Caveat:**
> "It depends. A lot of it has to do with what's changed on the property."
> — Sherry, MAP Engineering

**Not Automatic Approval:**
- 10 years is a guideline, not a guarantee
- Engineer must review EVERY survey before confirming usability
- Even recent surveys may be rejected if property has changed

---

## When Existing Surveys Cannot Be Used

### Property Changes That Invalidate Surveys

**Structural Additions:**
- Home additions or expansions
- New garages or outbuildings
- Deck construction
- Shed or storage structure installation
- Any building footprint changes

**Landscaping and Ground Changes:**
- Trees planted or removed
- Fence installation
- Pool or spa installation
- Retaining walls
- Grading or earth-moving
- Driveway expansion or relocation

**Other Disqualifying Factors:**
- Survey is 30-40+ years old (common issue homeowners don't realize)
- Property line disputes or changes
- Easement additions
- Utility installations

**Real-World Problem:**
> "We've seen surveys go back 40-50 years."
> — Sherry, MAP Engineering

Many homeowners don't understand that their ancient survey cannot be used for current engineering work.

## Survey Review Process

### Step-by-Step Engineer Review

**1. Homeowner or Agent Emails Survey to MAP**
- PDF or photo of existing survey
- Include property address
- Note any known changes since survey date

**2. MAP Forwards to Engineer**
- Email sent to engineering team
- Flagged for priority review

**3. Engineer Comparative Analysis (1-2 hours)**

**Engineer Reviews Against:**
- **Google Earth satellite images** (current property view)
- **Town property records** (building permits, additions)
- **Online databases** (parcel data, improvements)
- **Survey date and seal**

**Engineer Looks For:**
- Changes to building footprints
- New structures visible on satellite
- Tree coverage changes
- Ground disturbances
- Permit history indicating additions

**4. Approval or Rejection Communication**
- **If approved:** Proceed with existing survey (saves ~$1,000 and 1-1.5 weeks)
- **If rejected:** New survey required with explanation of why

### Response Time

**Turnaround:** 1-2 hours for survey review

**Fast Decision Benefits:**
- Quick determination saves days of uncertainty
- Immediate timeline and cost clarity
- Can order new survey without delay if needed

---

## Sealed Survey Requirement

### Why Seal Matters

**Health Department Requirement:**
- Most health departments require **sealed surveys**
- Seal indicates licensed surveyor verification
- Provides legal liability and accuracy assurance

**PDF Without Seal = Problem:**
- Homeowners often have PDF copies of old surveys
- PDF alone typically not acceptable
- Must have original with surveyor's raised seal OR new certified seal

### Solution for Old Surveys

**If Original Surveyor Still in Business:**

1. Contact original surveying company
2. Request they reprint and re-seal the survey
3. Pay minimal re-sealing fee (much less than new survey)
4. Saves significant money if survey otherwise usable

**Cost Comparison:**
- New survey: $1,600+ (under 1 acre)
- Re-seal old survey: $100-300 (if surveyor available)
- **Savings:** $1,300-1,500

**Timeline Comparison:**
- New survey: 1-1.5 weeks
- Re-seal: 1-3 days
- **Time saved:** 1+ weeks

---

## Topography: The Critical Component

### What Is Topography?

**Definition:**
Topographic information shows **elevation changes** across the property through contour lines and spot elevations.

**Why Essential for Septic Engineering:**
- Septic systems rely on gravity for proper drainage
- Engineers must calculate slope and grade
- Determines system placement and design type
- Required for proper drainage calculations
- Critical for compliance with setback and depth requirements

### The 99% Problem

> "99% of homeowners do not have topography on their existing survey."
> — Craig, MAP Engineering

**Standard Survey Includes:**
- Property boundaries
- Building footprints
- Easements
- Utilities
- Improvement locations

**Standard Survey Does NOT Include:**
- Topographic contours
- Elevation data
- Grade information
- Slope calculations

**Result:**
Even if existing survey is acceptable, topography STILL needs to be added (additional surveyor visit).

---

## Cost Implications

### New Survey Costs

**Under 1 Acre:**
- Survey without topography: ~$1,000
- **Survey with topography: ~$1,600**
- Topography adds ~$600 to survey cost

**Over 1 Acre (2+ acres):**
- Survey costs increase dramatically with acreage
- Topography becomes "really expensive"
- Can exceed $3,000-5,000 for large properties

### Savings Opportunities

**Using Existing Survey:**
- Saves approximately **$1,000** if survey acceptable
- Saves approximately **1 to 1.5 weeks** in timeline
- Must still add topography (~$600) if not already included

**Re-Sealing Old Survey:**
- Saves ~$1,300-1,500 vs. new survey
- Saves ~1 week in timeline
- Only viable if surveyor still accessible

**Total Potential Savings:**
- **Money:** $1,000-1,500 using existing survey
- **Time:** 1-1.5 weeks earlier soil test and design

---

## MAP's Quote Includes Survey

### Component #5 of 5 in Quote

**Quote Components:**
1. Engineering fee (MAP design services)
2. Soil log fee (excavation contractor)
3. Perc test fee (if needed)
4. Health department fees
5. **Survey with topography**

**Automatic Inclusion:**
- MAP includes survey cost in every quote
- Assumes new survey needed unless existing survey confirmed usable
- Conservative estimate protects against surprises

**If Existing Survey Approved:**
- Quote adjusted downward
- Refund or credit issued
- Savings passed to homeowner

## Agent Strategy: Survey Assessment

### Pre-Listing Checklist

**For Properties with Septic Systems:**

1. **Ask seller about existing survey:**
   - "Do you have a copy of your property survey?"
   - "When was it completed?"
   - "Do you have the original with the surveyor's seal?"

2. **Inspect survey if available:**
   - Check date (under 10 years?)
   - Check for seal (raised seal or certified stamp?)
   - Check for topography (contour lines present?)
   - Compare to current property (any changes?)

3. **Email survey to MAP for free review:**
   - Get engineer assessment within 1-2 hours
   - Determine usability immediately
   - Know savings potential upfront

4. **Set seller expectations:**
   - If survey usable: "Great news, we'll save $1,000 and a week"
   - If survey not usable: "We'll need a new survey, budgeted at $1,600 in the quote"

### During Contract Period

**Buyer's Agent Responsibility:**

1. **Request survey from seller:**
   - Ask for survey during attorney review
   - Expedite MAP engineer review
   - Start timeline clock ASAP

2. **Order new survey immediately if needed:**
   - Don't wait for failed seller survey review
   - 1-1.5 week lead time critical to overall timeline
   - Coordinate with MAP on surveyor recommendations

3. **Communicate timeline impact:**
   - "Survey adds 1.5 weeks to septic timeline"
   - "Total septic process will be 12-14 weeks instead of 10-12"
   - Adjust contract closing date if necessary

## Summary

Surveys with topography are essential for septic engineering but represent a significant variable in cost and timeline. While MAP Engineering includes survey costs in their automatic quotes, agents who proactively assess existing surveys can save clients $1,000 and 1-1.5 weeks.

The key is understanding that the "10-year rule" is a guideline, not a guarantee—any property changes invalidate surveys regardless of age. By leveraging MAP's free survey review service (1-2 hour turnaround), agents can immediately determine usability and set accurate expectations.

For the 99% of surveys lacking topography, knowing the additional costs ($600-800 for small properties, more for larger) and timeline impact (3-7 days) allows for accurate budgeting and scheduling.

**Agent success formula:**
1. Always check for existing survey
2. Send to MAP for free review (1-2 hours)
3. Order new survey immediately if rejected
4. Celebrate savings when survey is usable
5. Never let survey delays derail the septic timeline

Survey management is a critical path item in septic system replacement—handle it proactively to protect your closing timeline and demonstrate professionalism to clients.

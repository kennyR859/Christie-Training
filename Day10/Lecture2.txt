So I would say keep it up keep going you know it's it's all good you're off city will put you all over creation all of us saddle River saddle River Wyckoff Two thirds of Wyckoff is on septic you know and they're not planning on changing that ramsey Mawa all of us right around in here It's interesting how many times it it it's shocking actually you know Hillsdale we found one I found one up there as well and there are flood plates I mean anywhere you got a floodplain you got to really be careful because if it's a subject there is really going to have to go that's why this document is extremely important when you're taking your listing that you have the homeowners fill it out first of all it's the law now but this is your seller's property condition disclosure and this is where they'll disclose all that in the very near future The real estate Commission II think they passed the regulation or they're in the process but you list a property you must have the lead paint and the sellers disclosure put on at that time or maybe 24 hours within 24 hours so it is going to be required that we that we do that as Realtors I thought this was required already it's required that we do it but not that you put it on not not everybody puts it up online so that's where the association docu.... zip form that you don't have to call


The cost of a septic is by the number of bathrooms yeah it's not it's by the number of bedrooms you have So you have a three bedroom home a 4 bedroom one of the things that I always did if I sold a house that needed and by the way I think I've only sold one house that didn't need the septic repaired or replaced and all of our that did not need yeah so most of them will need something and I think it's as simple as telling your you know when you're counseling your sellers after you've got the listing going to say look there's some things we got to do and one is that I you know I say I have never found one I only found one that and it did have one little problem with baffle was needed to be replaced which was nothing but I've only found one that is in perfect condition it's amazing that's true you know so so you just be aware of the fact don't be shocked when you find out that they need an objective and the cost is all over the place so I like the idea that they recommended you get several different opinions But again it's by the number of bedrooms what I would do to Let's say you have a buyer that's coming in buying this house you need to communicate with the if it's somebody else's buyer need to communicate say this house is a three bedroom septic if your buyer has any intention of ever adding another bedroom or putting an addition on let's discuss the the splitting that clause So because my buyer is going to put in a three bedroom myself is going to put in a 3 bedroom if you ever think that you want more that this is the time to do it and and find out what a 4 bedroom would cost or a 5 bedroom would cost it doesn't matter if they had a great room has nothing to do with it doesn't matter if they had two more bathrooms nothing to do it only bedrooms right and the other thing to be aware of and always ask is the fact that you're selling house and it has 5 bedrooms right you need to ask if their septic is a five bedroom septic or is it a three bedroom septic or four bedroom you know because some people just go ahead and put an addition on and they never think of it right you know they and it doesn't even mean they have to move out of the footprint they could go and finish an attic and put bedrooms up right and then you then you have that issue as to whether or not you know it's going to pass muster how would you find out if they don't know you have to get the Oprah right I get it on every house you know it's really important and I think it's something that is good for you to offer your sellers that you'll you know and your buyers look I'll go get an open report for you it doesn't cost very much at all in fact most towns if they email it to you they don't even charge you.

for the rest of the text. it is related to Exclusive Right to Sell Listing Agreement. 

Residential Listing Agreement
exception
Transparency is vital in all of these contracts Why is the owners address different it's because it could be an investment property right so you got to put the right address and again when you go into platform all these things like listing broker ID sales person ID you know you can have that you can do that you know yourself but it will all default right there because of your because of the information that's already in platform agency disclosure So when you're listing a house So what I'm thinking you want you want this is definitely a exclusive agency right there is a space here for looking for it I don't see it AI OK I don't see that Oh here I'm sorry exclusive agency you're going to be the seller's agent right there on that line right So there's two different types of listings one is a an exclusive right to sell that's what we are that's what we take exclusive right to sell and AA exclusive agency it gives the seller the right to sell it on his own OK so never click that EA again it goes and asks how many bedrooms how many baths if they're solar and it's if it's leased or owned OK and then style sub style so style II recommend that you go to google and you google all the different OK all the different styles of bones and we'll go over it before the class is over so we know so it's a funny thing what you know style could be so when you when you're in the computer it makes it easier for you because it'll just say two story it'll say colonial it'll say but then the sub style is where it gets a little crazy so you could have a 2 story home or a colonial home that has the style of a tutor tutor's not necessarily the type of home it is it's more like the sub style so you could have one that's a contemporary you could have your basic 2 story home could be contemporary could be a tutor it could be you know Mediterranean it could be any style but you have to look go google those you know and understand what they are OK now why do we have ground floor and first floor Well ground floor would be for a bi level where it's on the ground right and then it would be the the first floor would be your living room dining room kitchen that type of thing in a colonial if 1st floor would be your living room dining room kitchen great room half bath whatever 2nd floor would be where your bedrooms are 3rd floor is in in some of these old Tudor style homes in Ridgewood they actually had a farmhouses they actually had a 3rd floor with bedrooms so it would be your 1st floor your 2nd floor and the stairway still goes up to the which was the attic but it's all bedrooms you might call it the attic but it's called 3rd floor because totally finished basement some houses don't have basement some do and heroes are a little thing items included and items don't include it make sure you're specific easements so let's say I'm taking the listing and I asked the homeowner do you have any easements I don't know I have no idea So what would you ask for to help you answer that question Yeah or the survey right the survey would show it you know and so it's important that you ask them to have a copy of the survey and a copy of the deed and they probably won't know where it is So you hope that maybe the town has it not the deed but they would have this maybe a survey or you know if they've lived there for 40 years they don't even remember who the attorney was who closed on it you know so your new attorney attorney they're going to use may have to do some research The town would know if there's any easements coming on and sometimes easements can be removed like I had a property it was a corner lot here and there was another lot back there and there was actually a road originally that went to the back and they removed that road they decided not to have that road there so they were like easements roads that don't exist So and they're gone so if they're gone the title company has to let you know and their title company would also know if there's any insurance right so there there's your research find out if there's any easements the title company probably the first place I'd go because they unless they have the survey they have a survey you can say maybe maybe not you know but the title company would really know and our title company will all you have to do is make up a call and they will be happy to tell you right taxes Where would you find that I'm sitting with you going over MLS public records So you go into the computer go into search and just look up the address of the property you know into your New Jersey MLS or whatever MLS and then look up the taxes on that house When you put the adolescence number does everything populate on the computer or well you don't have one yet 'cause we're writing it yeah once you do have one yeah but we're writing this up now over on zip forms doing it and so let's say before I go to a house to make my listing presentation II look up the address on my on the MLS right I go into the taxes and see get print out the whole all the information on the taxes you know the it'll have the square footage of the property it have square footage of the building it'll have the assessment it will have I'll break tomorrow tomorrow 0 no tomorrow's mark thursday he's coming before he gets here I'll go I'll bring my laptop and we'll go in and I'll show you where everything is it'll help you you don't want to take a listing without all that information with you you know you should have that there it will give you and you can go into Realist and it might give you even more information on the property sometimes realist even has a survey. Realist 


And the taxes will have that approximate lot square footage Rarely do they have the frontage you know in the in the MLS in the tax search but if you had a survey you would know the frontage you know so they're asking you for the lot square footage and then number of acres usually if it is 1/4 of an acre or half an acre but the frontage they they don't usually have for some reasons so why is that important what is frontage what is frontage let's say let's say this is the diagram of a lot and the house is right here this is the street this is the frontage And that's the length of our area what what it would be the length from from here to here so so let's say the house is right here and this is where they walk into the house and their driveways right here and this is the street it's facing that's that line would be the frontage but not necessarily is it that straight What if the house is on corner the frontage would be where the the address is so if it's on the corner of let's say E Saddle River Road and East Allendale 'cause we had a listing there the the front of the house was on East Allendale OK there are occasions where it can be confused and you could have two frontages you can find two different addresses for a house So yeah but that's so rare yeah but it's always the the when you go into the MLS and you put the if you not sure about the address frontage you can use the seller's name and then the house will come up and it will tell you what the address is the frontage is always where the address is so if it's 119 West Saddle River Road the frontage is 119 Saddle River Road if it's 2 O4 East Allendale that frontage is on that address. 

Schools
Again you can look that up that that may not necessarily be on the taxes but you can find it in Realist but again keep in mind that the schools can change So in Ridgewood for instance and I'm sure it's similar in other towns let's say this year you have probably 25 new kids going to Ridge School and next year there's 50 so they may divide a street off and put it to orchard or something right they can move it all around So you might want to say look these are this is what is now it's possible it could change and let them go to the school speak with the principal Don't you do it and bring the information back so look if you want you know if you want any information in school go and speak to the principal They're pretty good about that God bless you again items included we're going to be specific municipal assessments I probably would leave that blank until I find out for sure until I was absolutely sure the seller might know that they you can ask them have you had anything like a new sidewalk they might get assessed for that.

Realist - make sure you have access

------------------------------------

And then possession date this is an important date because unfortunately the the computer only defaults to one to 30 and 30 to 60 and 60 to 90 and 90 to 120 you know so you you you might have to under additional contractual if they really have a specific date which is unusual usually they'll fall within that category then you have to put it there in additional contractual provisions look we have to be out of here we have we're we bought a house already we have to be out of here by whatever date I would never tell the world that because it makes it look like they're desperate to sell but I would try to say you know seller would prefer to have their children registered in a new school by whatever you could do that if you want but or you could just let it default to a date right showing instructions asian remarks this part here this line this is not for the public right that's why you never send in fact the computer won't let you do it but even if you print out a report God bless you thank you never give the buyers the full report because there's stuff in there that the listing agent has put in there that is not for public not for the public to see right don't ever put anything that would be horrible for the public to see but it might be showing instructions it might be there's a key under a rock on the 3rd step going up you know you don't want the public to know that Most of the time we use showing time you know what showing time is have you all seen it on your computer you've been playing with the computer Play with the computer and look where showing time is right right there right in the right there in that line in blue right and it'll say showing time and you click on showing time you can play with it just don't really schedule a showing you click on showing time and you put your request in for the time you want it will come up with you know Monday Tuesday Wednesday whatever and then from like 9:00 in the morning till whatever time at night and it'll have little black things on it if it's not available will they block it out and then the time is open where it isn't blocked out so if you put in 2:00 put that in there and your and your name and all your information never puts the buyers name in there it'll ask you for your buyers don't put your buyers name in there There's two of those schools of thought on that by the way if you have your buyer if your buyer for sure assigned the agreement the buyer's agreement it's OK because that tracks that you bike that you did show the buyer there so if you have a buyer that you're not trusting I might put their name in there but there are other ways of recording it too so you can also win the buyer after you've left the home and you showed it to them and you just kind of don't trust them You would send an email to them or text them and say just wondered how you felt about the house at 123 Main Street and just leave it right and then you have the you have that OK so so showing instructions usually say you showing time call listing broker text listing broker and their telephone number will be there It might also say no showings between baby's nap time you know whatever time that is No showings after 8:00 at night no showings if they're religious from Friday night to Saturday night it may be you know a million different things might be there so pay attention to it by the way and again customer remarks that's where you use your you know chat GBT where you might do the the the description of the home you know this lovely four bedroom colonial sits on a private expansive lot you know house you know then you go into the bedrooms and they just you know well the description of the home look at the description of homes of other listings on the multiple it'll give you an idea of how how it should be written up remember there's certain keywords that we can't use anymore no more master bedrooms primary bedroom right no more walk to town right close proximity to town to shopping whatever Or you could you could even put you know you can get in your car or you could go on Google Maps and say let's say the house is two blocks from home from shopping you could say two blocks from from shopping two blocks from downtown You could also say you know how many like that a quarter of a mile an 8th of a mile you know 116th of a mile you can do that to make it clear some people really or to the train station some people really want to be very close to town schools trains right I had one customer and they the wife did not thrive absolutely that she couldn't she refused to drive she did not want to drive so they only wanted a house where she could walk to the grocery store she had a little wagon she went to the grocery store with her wagon the kids had to be able to walk just it was hard kids had to be whoever to walk to school she had to be able to walk to town And he walked to the train station but he drove so you know so you have to sometimes you find that now what would you do you can go in to Maps and see if there's any homes available within that little circle that you draw right Where would you go where would you find that you going into platter Perfect OK so Or or when you're. 

USE Turf

---------------------------
Here it says is it an EA or a or a seller's agent so you have to be careful with these words they jumble back and forth you know so it is an exclusive listing agreement it is an exclusive right to sell it's really the legal term and it will get to that down here So the listing date expiration date OK we put our dates in those are solid when you put a listing date in the the MLS requires that this type this state is has to be into the multiple within 24 hours right so that's why we don't want to put our listings in in 24 hours because who would have any pictures right we wouldn't have a brochure if we want to do a brochure we wouldn't have any social media lined up we wouldn't have anything done we wouldn't maybe we want to send out just listed cards even digital ones maybe we want to you know a whole bunch of stuff by the way marketing will send out for you on your listing just or just list that digital listing cards to wherever you want them They'll also send out like in Boost your open house if you're having an open house on this listing so again I know I've said this before but I want to reinforce it always take this form and make it an exclusive listing And again these words again but you are making it where just take an exclusive listing agreement you know where basically we are not going to put it out on the multiple It'll be in the multiple but it be in that hidden place we found it remember we found it and and do it for maybe 10 days right but on here it's the day that you take it and then the expiration date is still the six months but for a while we're putting it into the the exclusive agreement So so when we decide to launch it there's another form that you can pull up which is a change of status So what I normally do is to bring this with me but I also bring a change of status agreement now we can do this exclusive listing two ways one it is where we're sharing it you know it's Co op we're cooperating or non cooperating II recommend non cooperating simply because you got a lot of work to do and you don't want to be running over there showing it to people when you're not ready you won't have your information you won't have everything done so just do non cooperating that doesn't mean that people in your own office or in this company show it we still can show it but I but most of the time the person wants to get it ready They want to you know paint or something like that if that's the case you might want it more than 10 days right so how long is it did you order your pager yet what else did you want to do is there anything I can help you with you would like a recommendation on a painter a landscaper or something like that and then figure out well OK this is going to take them a month So then make your exclusive listing agreement for a month in the meantime you're working you can order pictures you can order whatever that you want to order and you can get your marketing together right why don't we wait the month and just put it on then OK I'd like to list with you but II want to paint the living room before I put it on so could you come back in a month and we'll list it What would you say to me now sign the listing form now and we can launch after a month yes why why do we want to do that why he may go to someone else and then the neighbor comes with a friend that wanted it and they sent it right on the right on and your listing agreement means nothing you know that you already got all the information together you're preparing the listing so the answer to that is wow that's great that's perfect because that gives me time to do and prepare all the marketing I need to prepare before we truly launch it well that's why we're saying let's sign it now gives you time to do what you want to do and me time to get my thing together I can put it in the multiple as an exclusive without you know without anybody seeing it But I can't start my marketing and my photos and everything I need to do unless we sign this document nobody has a problem with it they they understand it makes sense right So there you go you got this listing signed and you are ready to put it into the you know actually we don't even send the papers anymore we just think the marketing department knows that Randy will look over your listing your manager will look over your listing and they just give make them sometimes they want a copy of it sometimes they don't so depends you're also having that change of status form right that's in the multiple and it's in your zip forms and So what the change of status says OK so this is the 18th of November I would like to put it on the 1st of January well not the first of January the 5th of January or something like that so on the change of status it says change this from a office exclusive to a full listing on the MLS and you put that date on send that in automatically it's got its pictures now it's all set up perfectly you know getting your pictures isn't just sending the photographer there to take great pictures by the way then you take them back and you have to sit and review them and I see people just throwing them on it looks ridiculous they have a bathroom first and then a living room makes no sense so you want to organize them so as if you're walking through the house right Entry foyer living room dining room you know family room kitchen you want it all to flow nicely as if somebody's really walking through the home right and then there's some pictures that you don't want at all so you don't even take them I don't you know sometimes bathrooms are so small that the picture is just a picture of a toilet vault why would you do that you don't want to do that right so you just leave it that to their imagination OK.




-------------------------------

This is the part that everybody will call you after this of a listing and endeavoring to procure a purchaser for the property described above at the list of price of that's where you put the price after you do ACM right and then that's a price that you all mutually have agreed on that you incorporated member we talked about that you're incorporating the seller into the pricing by seeing them and comparing them to other listings in the area right with a possession date of and that's where you can put the you know the the real date if you want the seller the word seller indicates the owners whose signatures appear on the bottom of this listing agreement hereby grant broker to the sole and exclusive right to sell that's where the right term is there exclusive right to sell the above described property based on the terms and conditions contained in this agreement And then we get to the brokers FE This is what I do I always put it in there already I just stick it in there whatever you're asking don't ask them put it in right So the broker agrees to pay the broker a compensate compensation of 6% if the compensation is a percentage it shall be a percentage of the offering price or any other sales price accepted by the seller the compensation shall be earned by the broker and payable to the broker if the property is sold is sold by the seller the broker or through any other source during the term with this exclusive right to sell what does that mean that means like OK so you have the listing is being shown but some wise guy goes and knocks on the door you know it doesn't call the broker and then the seller calls up and say hey I got somebody here they they want to buy it you know do I have to pay you a Commission because I kind of got them myself yeah you do you know that's what that's paragraph is what protects you right Agency disclosure So I Fern Lambert and as an authorized representative of Christie's and you go through the whole thing and here's where you are sellers agent only transact transaction broker or seller's agent and disclosure agent if the opportunity arises you want to do that one seller's agent and disclose dual agent if the opportunity arise If you don't do that you explain to the homeowner then nobody else at Christie's can sell it right has to be Seller's agent and disclosed dual agent Now this is where everybody everybody asked the question what what how many days should this be it you know everybody's all over the place but in the event that the property or any part of it described in this agreement becomes subject to a written or other other agreement this is writing is getting so small lately and is transferred within so many days after the expiration of this agreement to anyone and this basically says that if it's within that time. You're entitled to your Commission as a listing agent right And this is where most brokers get confused So your listing expires and somebody in the neighborhood here and they go to see the house but they didn't see it during the term of your listing then you're out of luck OK but somebody who saw it during the term of your listing whether it was with you or another broker right And that's why you do have to keep some records if you want to pursue this you know then then you're entitled to your fee and so is the showing broker for a number of days after the listing is expired so you could a lot of people put 190 days You can put 365 days if you want you know now if the seller relists with ABC Realty within like a day after they they your listing expired they don't want to go back to you they want to go to ABC Realty All bets are off that paragraph just means nothing doesn't mean anything on the listing side right on the buyer side if an agent is there and somebody goes to see it if they have a buyers agreement with that buyer and the buyer goes with somebody else they may be entitled to a Commission but that's a whole different scenario right I want to take a break here and explain to you the rule the MLS rules on procuring costs how many know what procuring causes he was in your course I can't remember a little bit you do I think a little bit OK when there's a discrepancy between two agents or two brokerage houses as to who deserves the Commission the meeting of the minds is that who it is well sometimes they can't have a meeting of the minds right so there's a discrepancy you showed the property and you showed the property to the same person we have less of it now because you have those documents signed right but let's say your your your time expired or you didn't you didn't have it signed that would go to a different scenario but let's say you both say you're entitled to a Commission on this property right and it would go then to you can't make up can't decide what to do you can't you know you're not able to negotiate it and you have to go before the board and you will go there you'll make your case and you'll they'll decide through a group of your peers who is entitled to the Commission Let's say I show the property I do have the buyers agreement but then I never called the people back again or they ghosted me one or the other because they ghosted me I didn't call them back And then they go and they buy it from their sister in law who happens to be a broker and that was their intention all along because there's they were just using me to go show houses and then they wanted to buy it from their sister in law II might still get the Commission you know because they'll go through it so the things I would have needed to do though is not just not just ghost them because they ghosted me in order for me to get the Commission I would have had to keep in touch with them keep them abreast of any changes that happen to that listing let's say it got reduced right Let's say anything that went on with that listing I would have had to email them and keep them abreast of it right any changes in the marketplace like Commission not Commission interest rates just dropped like crazy Would have to let them know if I document all that I probably would have gotten most of the Commission without a doubt if all my paperwork was done properly you know in my records so it's not going to happen as much anymore but it will still happen because of the fire agreement the buyer broker agreement but keep in mind that those agreements can be terminated at anytime so let's say I show the property the seller the buyer is being unethical and they really wanted to work with their sister in law who just got her license but they needed me to show them around because she was busy right that's happened yeah and so I show them properties I show the properties and then they terminate the agreement and they go to and they signed the agreement with you and it's pretty obvious what they were doing right I might get the whole Commission So but that would go before arbitration and So what happens is you would have to write everything up do your research and then you apply they it's not it's they're really pretty fair and they take what they call a group of people that are similar you know equal to you in many ways you know and people who volunteer for it too so and it's a good thing and usually they come out pretty fair They usually come out pretty fair but that's what procuring causes it used to be and people still think it is the right of the original showing broker nowhere That is a very small part of it now it has to do with your ability your ability to give good information to keep in touch to follow through to have knowledge of the market your ability to assist the person and help them by the house so let's say you just show the house and they felt they couldn't afford it but you you found an affordable mortgage program you know and have them pre qualified under that or you were able to let them know hey guess what that house just was reduced it makes it more affordable for you A million different things you know could happen and or they had questions about needing something in the school you know some particular program in the school but you didn't know what you did and you said oh no this has a great program for this that great soccer teams they have great special ed they have you convince them that that school system was proper for them so a million different things could go in but it's all about it has a part of the original showing broker but it is also about your ability to service them property give them the right information that they need you didn't know where the bus line was we say 0 you know what the bus stops right in front of this house yeah a bunch of different things that could make a difference in their decision making right OK you won't look like you're tired are you.


---------------------------------------------

Of hearing pause we understand that this line here if it had a number I don't know what paragraph it is it would be usually put 190 days but if the let's say the seller objects to it then you really need to first number one these words are crazy explain to them what we're talking about you know and say why would you you know say look it's it is a benefit to you because let's say somebody that was here before wants to come back and buy it I know you might be thinking that you don't have to pay me but you might want to pay me because I you know I could help them go through the process Yeah And then back here in in Boulder writing it says that he has read this agreement in the New Jersey Attorney General's memorandum at the key Box disclosure has received the consumer information statement and fully executed copy of the agreement so Key Box how many keys are you going to get how many keys do you ask them for permission to get through yes and then over here unless this box is checked the seller does authorize the listing to appear on all websites It's kind of crazy what do you think it would be worded the other way check this box to be on all websites so you don't check the boxes and unless this box is checked property address will appear on all websites don't check the box unless they don't want their address and then you can and so then we just go to signatures so of course we have to have the Attorney General's you know memorandum done We cannot take a listing if anybody says what I don't want any green people in this neighborhood can't take that listing right absolutely walk out the door I would first advise him look it's against the law you know I can only take this listing if you agree that we cannot be prejudice right I try that if he says no you know there are some crazy grumpy old people you know and you say well Gee i'm very sorry I can't I can't take the listing you know you've lost i've won you've lost and so then OK and.

Important and then the disclosure of information on lead based paint randy just said this is now has to be uploaded into associated documents to have them sign that most of the time the seller says I don't know that's just fine I don't know it's fine and so make sure you sign it too because the buyer has to sign it the seller and seller has to sign it and this is again the informed consent to dual agency they just kill us with agency stuff And you know what this would be something good for you guys to really read the consumer information statements called the CIS on New Jersey real estate relationships read it and then of course the sellers property condition disclosure and that goes on and on and on so I'm going to reinforce one more time I know I've said it property disclosure you can't do it you can't sit with them I mean you're not supposed to touch it But what you can say is let's don't guess don't lie don't guess if you don't know just say I don't know and there's AA line for unknown I have sat with some of the most ethical people in the whole wide world and they're so worried about not answering properly that they try to guess and I explain to them this is this document can cause you to have a lawsuit if you don't do it honestly and if you really don't know I mean I'm telling you I could walk into 10 houses here in Richard just probably up and down the street I would say probably eight of them if I spoke to the wife and I asked you know what is the you know what what is the age of your oil your your guess your guest you know the guests this furnace they don't know what what kind of electricity do you have come in what's the average people don't know so you can help them by saying you know usually the date of your furnace your boiler or whatever you have is on it somewhere but if you don't know say I don't know hot water heater when was the last time you put in a hot water go say it right the year on the on the hot water yeah yeah that can be deceiving though because it could be hot water tank that was put in this year but it was built you know they had it in storage two years ago Yeah so you don't know but it's close anyway it can't be that old right so so those are things that you want to make sure that that you you you help your sellers by not guessing on this stupid document and years ago I could hand the document to people and say look you know fill it out at your leisure you know we don't need it until we have a buyer but now the law is changing and it has to go in with the listing and then be uploaded on the documents Would it be a good idea to leave that with them like if you went and did like a presentation and you sent them everything could you leave that with them and whether they go with you or not just sits there and it's just so they know it it could be in your 1st consultation when you 1st go through the house for them say here's a document that whether you list with me is generic it goes for every company whether you list with me or somebody else this is going to have to be formed and now it's a law that it has to be and Randy's I have to say but one thing about Randy he we have one of the agents here that's on the real estate Commission so he gets the information right away before any other broker knows about it so you're going to look smarter because you're going to say now it's just it's becoming the law that it has to go in immediately with the I want this dress and it's itchy I can't wait to go home and take it off Yeah so all these forms besides the property disclosure agreement we fill out with the person close enough you can or you can fill it out you know here II go by age you know and you can do it all on zip forms and just send it to the seller I like to do it in personal and have them sign wet a wet sign you know and but I fill it all out before I get there because you don't want to be sitting writing things you know Otherwise you know it'll take you you'll be there for three hours right so But I want to I want you to pretend you're doing another But you don't have to be to mark till 11 tomorrow are you going to go tomorrow or are you going to sit here what are you going to do i'm going to go tomorrow yeah OK what's the schedule tomorrow what are you doing in mower Mark good mark Sweetheimer he's going to go over Google business so OK so we'll figure it out if if you're coming here I'll come here if not I'll go to Mahwah you know So tomorrow mawa I'm sorry tomorrow is Mawa then OK Thursday is here OK and if we decide to stay at home and have that zooming yeah you can do it at home yeah Yeah maybe I will too I don't know we'll see you for Zombie I think you said you sent an email last week he was sending an email

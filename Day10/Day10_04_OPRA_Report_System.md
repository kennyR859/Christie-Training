# Day 10 - Topic 04: OPRA Report System

## Overview

OPRA (Open Public Records Act) reports provide critical access to public records maintained by local health departments regarding septic systems and property permits. Understanding how to obtain and interpret OPRA reports is essential for real estate agents handling properties with septic systems, as these reports reveal system capacity, installation history, and compliance records that directly impact property transactions.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Understand what OPRA is and why it matters in real estate
- Know when and how to request OPRA reports
- Interpret OPRA findings for bedroom count verification
- Identify red flags in septic system records
- Leverage OPRA for proactive due diligence

---

## What is OPRA?

### Definition

**OPRA = Open Public Records Act**

OPRA is New Jersey legislation that provides public access to government records, including:
- Building permits and certificates
- Health department approvals
- Septic system installation records
- Inspection reports and compliance documents
- Municipal assessments and violations

### Purpose in Real Estate Context

OPRA reports serve as a **critical due diligence tool** for real estate professionals, particularly when dealing with properties that have:
- Septic systems (not connected to municipal sewer)
- Unknown or undocumented system capacity
- Additions or modifications to the home
- Age of 25-30+ years (high likelihood of system issues)

**Legal Foundation:**
The Open Public Records Act requires government agencies to provide access to public documents upon request, with most information available at no cost when delivered electronically.

## Why OPRA Reports Are Critical in Real Estate

### Septic System History Documentation

**What OPRA Reports Reveal:**

1. **Installation Records:**
   - Original septic system installation date
   - Approved system capacity (bedroom count)
   - Engineer and contractor information
   - Design specifications and plans

2. **Certificate of Approval:**
   - Health department approval documentation
   - System type (conventional, ATU, etc.)
   - Compliance with regulations at time of installation

3. **Modification History:**
   - Repairs documented with health department
   - System upgrades or alterations
   - Failed inspections and resolutions

4. **Permit Records:**
   - Building permits for home additions
   - Pool installations requiring septic consideration
   - Other construction impacting septic placement

### Bedroom Count Verification

**Critical Use Case:**

The most important function of OPRA reports in real estate transactions is verifying that the septic system capacity matches the current bedroom count of the home.

**The Problem:**
> "You're selling a house with 5 bedrooms. You need to ask if their septic is a 5-bedroom septic or is it a 3-bedroom septic, because some people just go ahead and put an addition on and they never think of it. They could finish an attic and put bedrooms up, and then you have that issue as to whether or not it's going to pass muster."

**Why Bedroom Count Matters:**
- Septic systems are sized based on bedroom count, NOT actual occupancy
- Adding bedrooms without upgrading septic = code violation
- Buyer's septic inspection will fail if mismatch exists
- Creates transaction delays, unexpected costs, and potential deal collapse

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Finished Attic Bedrooms**
- Original home: 3 bedrooms, 3-bedroom septic approved
- Homeowner finishes attic, adds 2 bedrooms
- Current home: 5 bedrooms
- OPRA shows: 3-bedroom septic capacity
- **Problem:** 2-bedroom capacity shortfall

**Scenario 2: Addition Without Septic Upgrade**
- Original home: 2 bedrooms, 2-bedroom septic
- Homeowner builds addition with master suite
- Current home: 3 bedrooms
- OPRA shows: 2-bedroom septic capacity
- **Problem:** Septic undersized for current home

**Scenario 3: Basement Conversion**
- Original home: 4 bedrooms upstairs
- Homeowner finishes basement, adds bedroom and bathroom
- Current home: 5 bedrooms
- OPRA shows: 4-bedroom septic capacity
- **Problem:** Additional bedroom exceeds septic capacity

### Transaction Risk Mitigation

**Without OPRA Report:**
- List property assuming septic matches bedroom count
- Buyer orders septic inspection during attorney review
- Inspection reveals capacity mismatch
- Seller surprised by $35,000-$50,000 septic replacement cost
- Deal may collapse or require renegotiation

**With OPRA Report:**
- Verify septic capacity BEFORE listing
- Identify issues proactively
- Prepare seller mentally and financially
- Price property appropriately
- Avoid surprises during transaction
- Demonstrate professional due diligence

---

## When to Use OPRA Reports

### Pre-Listing Scenarios

**Mandatory OPRA Requests:**

1. **Seller Doesn't Know Septic Capacity:**
   - Common with older systems (30-40+ years)
   - Previous owners installed system, current owner has no records
   - No documentation retained from purchase

2. **Home Has Additions or Modifications:**
   - Any addition to original footprint
   - Finished attic spaces
   - Converted basements with bedrooms
   - Garage conversions to living space

3. **No Septic Installation Records:**
   - Seller cannot locate certificate of completion
   - No engineer or contractor information available
   - System predates modern record-keeping

4. **Preparing Property for Sale:**
   - 25-30+ year old septic system
   - Unknown maintenance history
   - Pre-listing septic inspection recommended

### During Transaction

**Buyer Due Diligence:**

1. **After Septic Inspection Ordered:**
   - Compare buyer's inspection to OPRA records
   - Verify inspector's findings against historical approvals
   - Identify discrepancies between reports

2. **When Buyer Plans Additions:**
   - Buyer intends to add bedrooms in future
   - Current system capacity adequate now
   - OPRA reveals if system can accommodate future expansion

3. **Investment Property Analysis:**
   - Investor considering property modifications
   - Need to understand septic limitations
   - Budget for potential septic upgrade

### Red Flag Properties

**Always Get OPRA When:**

- Property has been in same family for 40+ years (no recent records)
- Home built in 1960s-1980s (likely original septic, no upgrades)
- Multiple additions visible from exterior
- Finished attic with dormers suggesting bedrooms
- Basement with full bathroom (indicates bedroom potential)
- Large homes (4+ bedrooms) in septic areas
- Properties in towns with strict septic enforcement (Wyckoff, Wayne, etc.)

## Agent Best Practices

### OPRA Workflow Integration

**Standard Operating Procedure:**

**For Every Listing with Septic:**
1. ☑️ Ask seller about septic system age and records
2. ☑️ Request OPRA report from health department
3. ☑️ Review OPRA findings for capacity and age
4. ☑️ Compare bedroom count to OPRA-approved capacity
5. ☑️ Send OPRA to MAP Engineering if concerns identified
6. ☑️ Discuss findings with seller before listing
7. ☑️ Include OPRA in listing file documentation

**Timeline:**
- Request OPRA at listing appointment or immediately after
- Typical turnaround: 1-3 business days
- Review and send to MAP if needed: Same day
- Complete analysis before photos and marketing: Within 1 week

### Client Education

**Explaining OPRA to Sellers:**

**Script for Listing Appointment:**
> "One thing I do for all my clients with septic systems is request an OPRA report from the health department. OPRA stands for Open Public Records Act, and it gives us access to your septic installation records. This shows us the approved capacity of your system and helps us verify everything is in order before we list. It's usually free if they email it, and it only takes a few days. I've found it's much better to know what we're working with upfront rather than be surprised during a buyer's inspection. Does that sound okay to you?"

**If Seller Asks Why:**
> "Septic capacity is based on bedroom count, not actual occupancy. If you've added bedrooms over the years—like finishing an attic or basement—we need to make sure your septic was upgraded to match. The OPRA report tells us that. It's just good due diligence and protects both of us from surprises during the sale."

### Handling OPRA Findings

**When Capacity Matches:**
- ✅ Inform seller: "Great news, your septic capacity matches your bedroom count"
- Note system age and discuss potential inspection based on age
- If system under 15 years old, likely in good shape
- If system 25-30+ years old, recommend proactive inspection

**When Capacity Mismatch Found:**
- ⚠️ Schedule follow-up conversation with seller
- Explain the issue clearly without alarm
- Present options:
  1. Upgrade septic system before listing
  2. List with disclosure and price adjustment
  3. Remove bedroom designations to match septic
- Send OPRA to MAP for free quote on upgrade
- Discuss timeline and cost expectations

**When No Records Found:**
- ❌ Explain system likely predates modern record-keeping
- Recommend professional septic inspection
- Send inspection to MAP for interpretation
- Prepare seller for potential replacement ($35,000-$50,000)
- Consider proactive replacement before listing if system very old

### Documentation and File Management

**OPRA Report Filing:**
- Save OPRA email and attachments in listing file
- Scan any physical documents received
- Include in seller's file for liability protection
- Maintain copy for future reference

**Disclosure Documentation:**
- Provide OPRA findings to seller in writing
- Document seller's decision on how to proceed
- Include OPRA in disclosure package for buyers
- Maintain email trail showing due diligence performed

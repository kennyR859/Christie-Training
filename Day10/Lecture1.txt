That happen when you do have a home with a septic system you'll have it you'll have a report that you'll you know often start with and what happens if that report fails and some of the ways that we can help you so Craig is actually going to take it off i'm going to first share my screen and going to share our website and we're just going to essentially talk you through everything using our website and Craig you can begin whenever you're ready you're muted Randy and everyone and Christy's thank you very much for inviting us into your conference room this morning we're excited to be here thank you very much so we'll start with our website which is the culmination of a lot of work for my two colleagues here at them and Gary spent last winter doing basically two things interviewing installers and calling all the health departments in trying to get their fees so that this this system will be able to get you a quote a proposal for everything you need before you call it in store so those things we include our engineering fee we are our civil engineering company map engineering and tangent here but map engineering has been until 25 years still performing all the things we need our civil engineer to site plans pools retaining walls feasibility settings all those things our division the three of us are focusing on subject design So all those 12 days that they've got generate this as you go up to all the process of sorry about that but if you go to homeowners and click there that's what I was looking for my apologies this is our very intuitive form field that could not have been accomplished without the efforts of Dan and Sherry all winter when you fill this out and I recommend that you don't let your customer fill it out it's great way to fill it for you or for us if you'd like we'll do it with them whichever you prefer or if they're very very flexivity and we know about the property maybe you have an investor that's familiar with these things they could do it but it's a great opportunity for a year to get to know the customer concerns the most important thing for you is that you fill out the last four out of 5 deals there all about the dealer you do that so that as we move forward through the system you will get updates if anything happens so this is a patient closing this deal and finding your next list so I want to take a lot of weight no longer do you have to run around doing any of the things that you do It's a lot of work it's a lot of learning pets for example just to do a test or people that need to be there the client house the town and the person digging the hole and they're all scheduled on different times so we take care of all that instead of you worrying about making all those calls So that's where this starts when this is all done they'll get a proposal that include five things our engineering fee to the site the soil log fee for the person called Dig the P4 the the health department and lastly the survey was topography now we can use a survey if it's only 10 years old and no additional building has gone on If they have the survey you're going to find 99% of people do not have topography but it is essential for us to calculate that in our engineering plans and then we have a small document so that would come in 10 minutes after this as long as we have the town which we have 250 towns and properties on the way this will come to your email box in about 10 minutes so you know what needs to be done if they agree and move forward we're going to collect all that up front and we'll run around with checks instead of you running around with checks so hopefully you see some value in that Sherry's going to dig a little bit deeper and follow the path while we started and show you all about our contractors thanks again for having us and hope to work with you soon You need a question now thanks Greg so to take to take a little bit of bring the other question Randy I'm sorry I didn't see that Yes just the question is did you say that the person's survey has to be under 10 years old or they need a brand new survey In many cases a lot of it has to do with you know what's changed on the property if the person if the if the homeowner has had an addition if they've had any debt if there has been you know new trees planted trees taken down a fence to pull any of that absolutely we need a new survey we've seen surveys that go back to like 40 50 years what we normally do when we have somebody that's interested we ask the real estate agent or the homeowner to email the survey to us We will send the survey via email to one of our engineers and very quickly when they usually an hour or two they can take a look at it and they'll know between comparing that with what they see online on engine property records and Google Earth if that survey is going to work if they have a survey that will work fantastic because that will save some time in putting this whole septum process together if it does need a new survey then that will add some time but as Craig mentioned topography is something that most homeowners don't need and that topography really is essential in order for us to go take that 1st step and do that test because some of the properties we have are at least two acres or more that's a really expensive item I haven't had anybody else require a survey It depends again it depends upon how old the survey is you know if the survey is 30 years old you know again it's it's our engineers need to look at it so it's not 100 percent of the time that a new survey will be needed if it's 10 years old but you know we do really have to look at it and compare you know what's on the property It has to do with the town they'll have a survey and it's not scope and they want a sealed survey in most cases like health department or you know times when they sealed survey So they might have a PDF of it a lot of times I say hey if that surveyor is still around even if it's from an ADC if they'll reprint and seal the new survey for you but it's always case by case and we try to use it because it's if it's under an acre the survey is about 1600 bucks it saves him about $1000 if they don't have to do the survey and for us it saves US time it saves us about a week and a week and 1/2 to not have to get that survey so in most cases we would prefer to use the survey that they have but it's always going to be dependent on like you know what the health departments are going to require of us OK thank you.





0--------------------------------------------

Home inspection separately they'll be a septic inspection there are separate companies that do septic inspections versus home inspections if that report comes in the reports often can be cryptic they use terms that we're not all really familiar with we're also happy to look at any report that comes through because when you get them report you're often unable to tell if it's a repair that's needed and if it's a repair that's needed nine times out of 10 you're not going to need an engineer you'll just need an accepted company to make that repair and we do have people that we can refer you to in that case but if it's determined that an that a new installation is needed they also pull it an alteration it's the same thing if you heard the word septic alteration it essentially means whole new system I'm sorry somebody wants to join the call one second OK I lost my train of thought oh so if that septic report is deemed unsatisfactory our engineers will know they'll be able to steer you in the right direction so that's kind of the first thing we do that complementary so if you ever get a report you're happy you you can just send it to us and we can take a look at it our engineers can look at it and let you know if it does need a new system so once you do get that quote as Craig mentioned the next thing that happens if you don't need a new survey is to schedule the soil log and what that means we coordinate the health department our engineers either yourself as the realtor or the homeowner and we bring everyone together oh and it installer and installer comes out and excavating contractor and they do a soil log they dig holes on the property to help determine what type of systems going to be need to be designed and that's dependent upon what else is on the on the property is there a well are there other septics that are close by what type of system and where on the property is going to be placed also if there's any water anywhere close to the property that will determine what type of system our engineers design as well so once that soil log is completed we take that soil back to our office we have a little lab in the back we do some tests to help determine what type of soil what type of soil it is and what type of systems going to be designed and then we're able to actually start the design our engineers work very very quickly they're usually able to pump out these designs within two business days which is really amazing once that soil log comes back and they determine what they're going to design Once that design is completed the next step is to deal with the health department we hand deliver everything to the health department up until about 89 months ago when our new ownership took over the company we used to take that design print it out mail it to the homeowner give the homeowner instructions on where to go what time they needed to be at the health department because of course they take long lunches they are closed for every holiday and take that little Japanese homeowners don't have time for that they're just trying to get their house sold and you as a as an agent don't have time for that either you're trying to you know just get to the closing table on your next listing That's something that we handle now and we keep you in the loop every step of the way once the design is completed we let you know if you need if the homeowner wants to see a copy of the design they can see it just to make sure you know they're fine with what what's been designed and then we go to the health department and we expedite and simplify everything with the health department to try and get that approval back as quickly as possible once that improvement once that permit does come back and it's approved the next step is to work with your homeowner to choose their contractor And what we did to make it easy for homeowners to see who's in the network we we divided everything by towns so say for example they're buying a house in Upper Saddle River with a septic and again you can help them with this as well or they can do it on their own we know that often finance is a concern because a septic is something that's fairly expensive relative to other things that they're going to be doing to help close so we did ask our contractors if they work with two or 3K loans if the buyer or the seller whoever is going to be paying for that septic most of most of the time it's a seller occasionally it is the buyer sometimes they'll put the money in escrow and the buyer will take care of it 2O 3K loan might be an option for them or often they need to pay a closed situation we have plenty of guys that will do that as well And then below that you'll see all of our installers at Service Bergen and again we've got a similar look to a web page for every county out there And incidentally we were in northern and a little bit in Central County so Central New Jersey so we work in Bergen to say Morris Sussex and now we're moving into hundred 10 Somerset and Warren so those are the areas that we cover as of now and if you go through this list those of you that have you know worked getting septics replaced you'll see some people that you know that are local like who's in Woodcliff Lake And then be septic is also you know fairly close to the area and we have some small companies and large companies so there's really something for everybody here and what we did for each homeowner for each I'm sorry for each contractor we created what we call a mini web page we asked each contractor to give us some photos we picked up some reviews from Google it'll give you the name of the person you can find out what else they do perhaps there's some masonry work or some landscaping work that needs to go to be done to help close as well We have guys that that help you with that reviews and where they're based this gentleman happens to be based in so we always recommend that every homeowner get three bids this is a really expensive endeavor relative to to other things that they're going to be doing we want to make sure that they're getting bids that that they're happy with and incidentally we don't really get involved in getting the bids will what we do is we send the plans to the contractors so we'll help you choose three contractors and again we know you know if it's something has to be done quickly we know the schedule we all control these guys in advance and say hey you know you're interested in a bid in Oakland for example and if they say no I'm too busy I can't do anything for the next month we wouldn't recommend that you go to that person we'll we'll help you find three people that are that are going to be able to do the job pretty quickly so we send the plans to the contractors Your homeowner will get the bids in from the contractors if they need any help if you or your homeowner needs any help deciphering the bids we're happy to look at them and the bids usually will come in you know in a similar range it's not like you're going to get it shouldn't be that you're going to get one bid that's $20,000 more than another or even $10,000 but if you do then there's a problem we'll get you a fourth bid if needed So once your homeowner and you have decided who they're going to be using to to do that install again we stay in the loop every step of the way and we oversee everything our engineers have to go out 456 times during the process to do certain inspections that are required from the health department and once the septic is fully installed we deliver that certificate of completion and the As built to the health department they look everything over they stamp it and then your homeowner is able to get that final certificate of completion and they're able to close and that's it so it does take time it's something that is a necessary evil but think of it this way your home will be so the home will be sold with a brand new septic you know after going through this whole process So that's a little bit about what we do I don't know if anyone has any questions on this Yeah you have to I thought I hit it there it is no you have to hit the mic Randy or your muted I think I see chatting to Daisy hi so so the payment at closing do you do you put like a contractor's lien on the home No what we do we get we usually get the attorney involved we have a template of a letter that we ask the homeowners attorney to fill out we don't we don't get involved with loans or home contractor loans we just have it have this letter sent sent filled out agreed to by the whole order in the attorney and then once and usually there's there's rubbish in there so it says payment and house close for 30 days after because sometimes you know unfortunately things happen and there's not opposing and you know you don't want your homeowner to be I mean the homeowner should be responsible even if they don't close but the the attorneys know how to word the letters and again we have a template that you can send yeah I didn't say long I said Liam right no we don't get involved in leaves at actually

--------------------------------------------
You get a check in the power company and we're all good to go I will say that you do need to make sure that you have a contract I have one situation where a seller is like I got a set pool and I'm not getting anyone to you know no bikes in the house you know can I do you guys have are you on the contract you said no Mike OK well you got to be at least in the contract moving in the right direction someone wanted to put the home so that's a really big important thing Other questions our group here doesn't seek have any questions I don't I didn't see who else is on on the webinar let's see Diane you have a questions Her mic is muted oh she's muted as well sorry Feel like a bit of a breakdown just a time frame Just what I've noticed in in starting new ownership in terms of the last 10 months I can tell you what we used to do is we used to mail the proposal to the homeowner and then we have to wait for a check to come back and lose weeks there everything's automated online so payments will be made online they can use credit card they can call in and not get used to a ACH when we have a survey and and you know it's approved and we're able to use it we're booking that mark out for the test polls within the next five days so I was like to use the reference so let's say it's a Monday and your your buyer or sellers inside of the door you know besides to move forward with us that next Monday we're booking the workout as long as the health department is available They're coming in and doing the tech hold at one week away and by Wednesday or so Thursday as long as we have the topography continued we're we're done with the design so with that that design and everything is in and out of our hands within less than two weeks and and getting ready to be approved by the health department obviously sometimes there's some some dips I don't know if anyone works in or has ever worked with Jefferson It takes them about 94 years to send me Oprah so some things are just out of our control especially just in terms of receiving information that we need in order to proceed forward but when everything runs smoothly and we have no bumps in the road with Oprah's or we've got a survey on file and part of these completed we're really really quickly our time frame prior to these changes one woman said that you could give birth 3 times before things could could make it you know move move on on our end so it's been a tremendous I'd say blow up in the last 10 months since we've been here also communication and I don't even think it's just our environment firm if you guys have ever worked with another engineering firm when I'm hearing it it's just hard to get people on the phone go stand in here they're drawing they're in the field they're doing test polls and so you don't always get that readily response whereas with us you have a project manager you have myself you have Sherry you have Craig someone that you have a direct nectum there's times where I get up from my desk 'cause I rework it off I work in office I'll go to my engineer and say I needed a response like now I know you're drawing or I know you're in the field and I'll call him and I'll bug them so we understand for you guys this communication timing is everything so you know we took into consideration as we implemented this this formatting we'd have tremendous feedback already we're starting to get really great reviews in on our local business profile are you guys talking about that in just in regards of our efforts in making your life a lot easier with these subjects So what what is in your opinion what's the average life of a septic man It should at least be 2530 years but so many variables especially user usage you know doing 35 loads of laundry a day or flushing leaves or just things that maybe a homeowner doesn't know or sanitary items down you know so if everything is working you know nicely like my mother in law septic is is a 50 years old i'm I'm living in a home right now that's a 3030 year old system of curiosity would you provide us with a list of do's and don'ts on how to care for you something I was just gonna say that because oh you just are copycat Diane Yeah predominantly don't understand and never lived in a home with a septic system it's really important for us to give them education regarding how to take care of a septic system and if there's something that you can give us as far as some kind of like a do's and don'ts list before number one any product that says septic safe should not be using separate system i've heard that by the engineers quite a bit but you can't trust that anything is septic safe those white bees and all that they should not go in at any time But I hear you like a nice like list of yeah and then if you can brand your company information on that to this way like if they have questions you can they can call your email you that would be really helpful as far as this and I'm speaking about first time home buyers specifically because most funds do not understand septic they get overwhelmed and they don't know what they're doing and that would be really helpful That's a great idea I have another question what is your recommended time of having it cleaned out I've heard two things that you never should clean it you should always be able to have the chemistry work but I don't know do you need clean out like pumping having a pumping pumping yeah yeah every at least every three years my system's older so and I do every two years just to kind of play it safe If you have an ATU system it's also getting maintenance twice a year so there's filters that are being cleaned and then you would still want to pump it every three years but that's kind of like the recommendation that you'll hear from the pumping companies what was the system you said with the filters what did you say ACU like an advanced treatment unit versus the conventional unit the ATU systems have to be maintained twice a year Again I'd like talking about like doing these types of maintenances on septic systems the majority of these buyers don't understand that and then they get into a house and they're you're not following the specific protocol for septic so if there's literature that we can hand out to a client I think that would be beneficial not only for your company but also for the buyer absolutely you know what they we're actually we just started doing I call now what are they accept this we're doing our first official webinar today where we're taking about 20 minutes and tomorrow we're talking about like how do you interpret basically a septic report so this might for maybe January a webinar a webinar might actually be septic using don't and still create that literature for you in the homeland i'm from Belleville NJ I grew up on sewer so when I got a when I got a septic I'm like what this is this is well it was it was like a night and day difference so I completely understand what you're saying education is everything Why they're flushing oil but they're pouring oil down the drain just because they don't know any better tampons and just things that they shouldn't be doing or something I'll give you an example my mother in law when she has a big prey in her house she ran supportify i'm like you have two bathrooms she's like yeah but this septic is built for a 5 bedroom system for a 5 bedroom house not 60 people flushing it in in one day you're going to overload the system so that was something I'm like oh I didn't even realize so things like that II had AA several Halloween parties in my barn and I ordered two porta potties Yeah four years four years you have to put it you have to put a sign in in the bathroom do not flush It's really sad that you have to do that most people don't understand that most people have municipal and sewer lines so they don't understand so then then they have an issue and then we all know how closely that can be so I have a skeptic the guy that just I spoke with someone yesterday it's not even changeable anything failure does the feel the statue saturated so that is just one it could be what they'll do is they'll test it they'll make sure that the sand was the quality was good right so we're going to do all everything on the engineering side which you know we already have the paperwork in C33 with the best and possible but it was usage and 99.9% it sure was usage you know he had his family come from a different country live within six months of the year so how many OH-6 that's a lot of people if it's only a two bedroom setting you know so just not knowing and not being aware and cognizant of it you said do's and don'ts OK that's a great idea we're going to do it we're going to do it thanks diane.



---------------------------------------------
I have a request I need business cards for my card holder out here Brandy Brandy i'm right here in town i'm going to stop over tomorrow i'm going to bring you a bunch of brochures and a card holder OK I had the original brochures but II didn't I need more cards 'cause I can put them on there OK I'll come over tomorrow and bring those over super and just one thing too we're offering $250 off our engineering fee if you if you have a homework that mentions like hey you know my realtor recommended you guys or based on your presentation and given 250 off the one that stay top of mind we do a newsletter once a month I promise you it's just once a month just to kind of keep us top of mind and things like this where like this November's newsletter was all about that like you're the second report and how to interpret it tomorrow's webinar is going to kind of dig a little bit deeper i'm going to talk about talk to some of the different languages because the septic inspection companies make the health department and the engineers the bad guys and I'll tell you why they do that so like you said education keeping us top of mind and being like you're kind of like your go to folks when you run across that unsatisfactory report OK you can always you can always email it to me and I can then put it into the group email and send it out perfect we'll do that i'm sorry I missed the first you know I I'm sorry I know like probably repeat yourself but are you you don't do inspections right or you do inspections no no inspections OK good all right I have a quick question can you hear me Yeah I jumped on a little late too so you repeated yourself I apologize but you know if you're taking a listing and and the people that your your clients your sellers have a septic system that you know is 25 30 years old maybe even sometimes more they think it's absolutely going to be fine but you suspect because of the knowledge of the town and the inspectors and the health departments etcetera etcetera But probably more than likely it's going to fail they're going to need to replace the whole 7 system I just I just want to get an idea from people how they navigate because people do not receive that kind of thing really well and I don't know whether most agents would wait for CSI or somebody to come in from a potential buyer or would you recommend strongly and I think I know the answer to this probably in our best interest to get in front of it and try to proactively you'll have it in fact it but the danger in that is is is kind of a good news bad news you're kind of like the you know you're the bearer of of of dentally bad news and you know always maintain that this is not the other thing a lot of people think they're going to be fine with it so I'm just curious how people how people navigate in in those situations II think with the example my mother-in-law is in Boonton Township and she's selling her home and usually it's the buyer right that'll get the report I said I said 5 year old system you get your own reported first so that you can at least know what you're walking into and then now you'll have two you'll have your report and you'll have the buyers report and then you can prepare compress because sometimes it's like drastically different it's sometimes really good to have the two different reports and on on their report it was it it put the system almost like it was in failure and then her report is it was repairs and then when I actually looked at it from with an engineering eye she she is it's actually not complete because they couldn't get to the D box not to go into the woods but it's better to get ahead of it so that you know what you're you're looking at and it prepares them mentally because it's like when you're under contract and you're hit with all of a sudden now you've got this failing system it's a shock to the system but it is an objective call so you have no answer it's not like you're you're not the bearer of bad news getting in front of it as an agent you know you're kind of like you're pushing bad news so I'm just curious how people like you know kind of you know I don't know whether it's probably the best thing you just let the process play out and sort of you know you know what you can make us be a bad guy you can get the reports you know I'm going to send this over to my my engineers i'm going to have them look at it and then give us like the complete rundown of what's happening Again just for my own knowledge of like educating myself for this weather or tomorrow the inspectors can't specifically say that it's in failure or it needs to repay it's very ambiguous so you have to have someone look at the the report take into consideration like if a 35 year system the laterals are clogged or the field is saturated you have to have an engineer to say this is completely shocking your system or but ultimately it doesn't like CSI come in the door inspection and then like if it's wyckoff or something like that you get like a mark degenerative fails it. And they have to replace it depends it depends on again in certain towns where it would be a repair i'm dealing with 1 right now wayne will not it's a great water system the Gray water is going nowhere and they want to just repair it and and take the Gray ward and pop it right back into septic and when he's like yo OK yeah well it's a it's it's like this and so it's really because the report says you can repair it you go it's neither prepared just take the great water system and and just connect it to the septic get a plumber you know no problem and wings like no you need an engineer to to assess the field so it's like they they they do make sense engineer and the town and the health department of bad guys but that's where you are going to be proactive you can have us look at it before and you can get to front of the buyer and you know what you're walking into well you're not proactive and you've got a conflict and all of a sudden you know there's an inspection and you need a whole new system you're feeling you've got a time issue though What's something like that cost you give me an idea for five bedroom like $35,000 no I'm saying as far as your company coming out and taking a look at a potential seller ahead of listing it no no well just the report we don't even charge you we'll just look at the report for free it takes Yeah just yeah we do Yup that's great I got three on my desk right now like I need to go through my engineer and say OK this is what I see but when you you know when you know what do you know one a little cyber we are not the ending is we have a team of engineers here right in our office that we work with well we learned we learned very high level stuff i've learned but when it comes to making that decision I sharing great needle make decision I let my engineer tell me exactly I have and so explain to me why so that I can educate myself and be a little more knowledgeable but we don't charge for that service okay good to knowing
